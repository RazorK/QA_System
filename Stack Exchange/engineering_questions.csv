4,I think actually the first row is needed is a barometric height formula for the mix of gases The main problem I can see the curves describing the minimal energy (kinetic + gravitational/centrifugal) won't be any more a simple derivative but a functional equation I think this or similar equations could be useful in very separate areas (isotope separation estimating high atmosphere components of planets etc ) Despite I couldn't find anything with google about this So the question is we have a high gas mixture in constant g gravity and T temperature We known the p1 p2 partial pressures of the gases on the h=0 Of course we know every relevant constants of the gases too What is their minimal-energy isothermic height-dependent partial pressure function pn(h),inzinjerstvo,248
6,The United States have different rules about exactly how one obtains an engineering license but the general process is the FE exam a few years of work and the PE exam Suppose one then wishes to practice engineering in Germany What are the legal requirements for doing so,inzinjerstvo,8
9,I am currently having an issue where features of my machined parts are warping Using a feeler gauge and a certified calibrated granite slab I am getting out-of-flatness measurements up to 009 which is significantly out of tolerance relative to my requirements I have decided to construct a statistically-designed experiment ( design of experiments ) to find which specific factors are playing a role but I want to ensure that I am including all of the factors which may contribute I don't want to lead the conversation too much by posting what I already listed but I am looking for others' opinions on what might cause this kind of warping/deflection,inzinjerstvo,30

14,I think here is the main problem the difference between the internal and the external temperature For example in Saudi Arabia in 50 C a passive house needed probably much sophisticated planning as in Paris Compared to the traditional cooling systems in the second case is enough only to get a cooling system with bigger power I think they are much more scalable Is it anyways possible,inzinjerstvo,142

20,I'm making a robot for the Sparkfun AVC I was curious if I could use only the knowledge about How the car is being steered at every time interval How many times the wheels have rotated to get a general sense of where the car is I would use computer vision to avoid immediate dangers The biggest problem is any slipping causing false counts,inzinjerstvo,36
22,I recently had a project where I made an aluminum linkage (similar to a scissor lift) operated by linear actuators Aluminum pieces were fabricated from 6061 standard aluminum stock 6mm (0 25 inch) thick The bars are at most 750x75mm (30x3 ) The application was mostly cosmetic (for a special effect) rather than lifting or exerting much force I used shoulder bolts with a nylon washer between the aluminum pieces to reduce friction and standard zinc-plated steel washers on the exterior sides The problem I encountered was tightening the bolt too much would result in too much friction whereas too loose would result in one of the aluminum pieces coming slightly off the shoulder of the bolt skewing and causing similar problems What would be a better way to create a reliable pivot point that doesn't require constant adjustment I put together this illustration as an example per Nick's suggestion,inzinjerstvo,83
26,As far I know the depleted fuel cells are crushed and solved in nitric acid What is coming after that This nitric acid should probably contain a very wide spectrum of different salts (practically all of the elements between 35-65 and yet a lot of transurans and a lot of uranium (both of 235 ad 238) and plutonium) To reach an efficient reprocessing the uranium (or at least the actinid elements) should be somehow separated from this solution But AFAIK they have very different chemical properties How is it possible to separate only the transuranic materials,inzinjerstvo,43
28,I am wondering if there is a spring strong enough and light enough to inflate an airtight membrane so that it floats at Standard Temp &amp; Pressure As an example a 10cm cylinder would displace just under 1 gram of air but a cylindrical spring would have to oppose 162kg of atmospheric force in that configuration Is there such a thing as a 162kg 10cm cylindric spring that weighs less than 1 gram But that's just one spring design More generally what spring designs provide the highest rate/weight ratio What are the current practical limits on spring rate vs spring mass and using what materials,inzinjerstvo,111
31,I have some height-adjustment nuts screwed onto vertical threads to support my print-bed for a 3D printer They are domed nuts and the aluminium build-plate sits on top of the domes three holes in the plate align with the domes to hold the plate in place How can I protect these nuts from vibration loosening without using thread-locker or similar so that they remain adjustable,inzinjerstvo,40
32,I've found myself tapping and threading a lot lately and doing so with hand taps and dies What would be the next step up from using a drill-press to cut holes for tapping and a lathe for turning parts to diameter for threading What are options for making this easier and more precise short of a 6-figure screw or CNC machine,inzinjerstvo,205
33,It's true that most bridges are two directional But three way bridges are pretty rare globally I can understand why there wouldn't be many for rivers but if bridges are designed based on the lie of the surrounding ground why wouldn't there be a large number of non-river sites that would support such bridges On the other hand three out of the world's bridges exist in Michigan (and only ten or so elsewhere in the United States) What is it about the land topography or other features of Michigan that cause it to have a disproportionate number of the country's and world's three way bridges,inzinjerstvo,75
34,My design uses a round steel bar inserted through a hole in an aluminium component with a tight fit (no movement) The operating environment is dry 20-40°C Do I need to worry about galvanic corrosion and if so how long will this last before starting to corrode Also what storage conditions should I avoid that would accelerate the corrosion,inzinjerstvo,41

37,I am starting to use steel in some of my designs and while trying to learn more about this material and its properties I have realized that there is so much more to it than I thought How does the grading system used for steel work For instance what does Grade 11SMn30 mean and how does this affect the properties of the material Answers/comments indicate there are multiple standards which I did not know but I've found out that this is an EN grading,inzinjerstvo,53

49,This is similar to my Physics SE question Microtops sunphotometer sun target optics - there I was asking about the optics principles (the answer is no good for my understanding but I have been able to figure it out myself) The purpose behind a sunspotter is to show when a device is lined up in direct view of the sun - vital for fields such as sunphotometry etc This question is given that I now understand the optics principles involved (similar to a magnifying glass but smaller and does not burn when focused) - what method can be used to make a rudimentary sunspotter In particular I am interested in a suitable material that would be used for the sun target (as per the Microtops picture on the linked page) the same orientation of the sun target being perpendicular to the incident light What I am not interested in any device how to make a device that allows viewing of things like eclipses,inzinjerstvo,105

52,I am looking for multi-position bi-stable solenoids So far I have only found one vendor 1 with a 3 position bi-stable solenoid Are there multi-position bi-stable solenoids with more than three positions How can a 3 position bi-stable solenoid be mechanically amplified to multiple positions Why are these such a rare commodity What are the alternatives other than stepper motors 1 Note I'm not looking for a vendor recommendation I'm trying to find out if I'm looking for the right thing,inzinjerstvo,247
54,I am thinking mainly in $\frac{kWh}{m^3}$ and $\frac{\$}{m^3}$ In the past some decades a wide range of surprisingly efficient water desalination plants were built mainly in desert regions (Middle East) These plants use reverse osmosis viaa system of multiple prussered membranes This solution seems to be very effective in the sense of energy usage But it is not enough Comparing the desalination prices (coming mainly from energy costs) to the alternatives a further 60-90% reduction is yet needed Comparing them what development potential is there in water desalination I think water desalination has probably a theoretical energy limit which could be maybe calculated from entropy and binding energy formulas How near are we to this theoretical limit,inzinjerstvo,116

63,The debate of traffic circles (also called roundabouts or rotaries) versus traffic light intersections has been in progress for a while Those in favor of traffic circles say that among other things that they are safer than traffic light intersections This claim has been scientifically proven On the other hand traffic light intersections are more space-inefficient Even Mythbusters has joined the fun testing the efficiency (which is one of the main arguments both sides seem to concern themselves with) of each method For comparison here's a quick picture of a traffic circle And of a four-way traffic light intersection So what are the pros and cons of a traffic circle versus a traffic light intersection,inzinjerstvo,76
66,I know that my input signal contains a main sinusoidal signal and I know its frequency but not its amplitude Until now I have been successfully using the least-squares method to generate a sinusoidal signal with the least difference from my input However this method breaks down when faced with slightly more complicated input signals where the noise is big enough to disturb the list square As a consequence it's not efficient anymore What are some other ways I can accomplish this filtering that don't have the same issue,inzinjerstvo,70
68,I have a 2mm thick steel plate which is 300mm long and 30mm wide supported at either end It supports a weight-bearing wheel that can roll along the plate It currently supports the maximum weight that I expect it to support when the wheel is in the middle but it flexes a little bit too much Would making it wider help to support the weight and increase its stiffness or do I need to make it thicker Also is there a way to calculate how the stiffness will change with the thickness (or width if that would affect it),inzinjerstvo,69
73,A highly desirable property of metals like gallium and indium is that they are able to wet glass Normally as metals they wouldn't be able to form an airtight seal when in contact with glass But they are able to do so and they can be used in applications where an airtight seal is required (e g vacuum gaskets) That said indium and gallium are somewhat expensive (at press time around 700 USD/kg and 250 USD/kg respectively) Industrial compounds that also have similar properties such as Galinstan (even though the glass still needs a wetting with gallium oxide first) aren't much better What are some metal substances that are both cost-effective and able to wet glass with an airtight seal that can be used in industrial applications,inzinjerstvo,201
74,One of the valves on my 3 bar line just failed Without it our production has ground to a stop and we can't operate until we get a replacement (which we have already ordered) In order to make a deadline I am trying to find a way to use a (properly rated for pressure) DN 16 flanged valve to fit with the existing DN 10 piping Is there any way to (safely) connect these two flanges together temporarily,inzinjerstvo,314
84,I need to pump a thick slurry from a tank The slurry can be pumped but won't flow well enough that I can use a suction pump from outside the tank Normally I'd use a centrifugal immersion pump that can be drawn from the tank for service But with the thick slurry I need to use a PD pump One option that I'm looking at is a monopump housed in a long pipe so the rotor/stator packet is submerged and operated by a long shaft in the pipe But this will probably get expensive and I'm open for other options Another consideration is ease of service the immersion pump linked above would have to be lifted with a crane out of the tank for service The application is agricultural / bio-energy; tank depth is 4m So I'm looking for a PD pump that is capable of pumping thick slurries can be put into my sump pump and retrieved for service with low effort (which probably rules out long driveshafts) I'm mostly hunting for ideas no need for a concrete product recommendation,inzinjerstvo,118
86,For one-off bespoke electronic products or ventures on low budgets what is the cheapest way of ensuring the product conforms to EMI/EMC requirements of CE marking This can be at design time and / or throughout the manufacturing process Examples A small-run electronic microprocessor based controller (using a CE-Marked zero-cross solid state relay) intended to switch on or off a 2kW load such as a consumer grade 240V 2kW blower heater A one-off CNC machine that utilizes CE-marked low voltage motors and servos and is controlled by a microcontroller and miscellaneous circuitry A new venture into producing LED lighting with controllers - typically switching 10W loads; using PWM to control brightness; controlled by a micro-controller; using SMD LEDs and a CE-marked switched-mode 24V 3A PSU Obviously there must be logical principles which one can apply to allow one to bypass other expensive conforming methods For example connecting two CE-marked appliances to each other where they are intended to do so would most likely not need any further testing The problem is that for more complicated scenarious getting products approved by external companies that provide CE-marking assessments can be incredibly expensive Also I have not found any particularly affordable equipment/methods to carry out EMI/EMC testing - and not being an expert in EMI/EMC means I would not be confident about using such equipment effectively,inzinjerstvo,90

89,It is common to lift bridges to replace bearings etc In an ideal world the lifting capacity required of the jacks would be the self-weight of the bridge divided by the number of jacks (+ allowances for wind/snow etc ) From my (limited) experience however bridges begin to 'stick' to their bearings and an additional allowance for over-coming this has to be provided Does anyone have any guidance about how to determine this figure,inzinjerstvo,115
100,Prince Rupert's Drops are glass objects created by dripping molten glass into cold water While the outside of the drop quickly cools the inside remains hot for a longer time When it eventually cools it shrinks setting up very large compressive stresses on the surface The result is a sort of toughened glass you can hammer the drop head without damaging it but a scratch on the tail leads to an explosive disintegration Check out this video So is it possible to build spherical Prince Rupert's drops And if so how One example of an application is as a replacement for traditional ball bearing spheres There will be improvements in wear resistance and maximum loads tolerable and a glass sphere would cost less anyway,inzinjerstvo,239
101,Sometimes underground pipelines are exposed due to vertical scour or lateral migration of streams (or other erosion) One option is to lower the (in-service) pipeline to a new depth that provides sufficient ground cover How can I determine the mechanical stresses on the pipe and determine how much the line can be lowered Also required is determining what length of trench will be required to accommodate the lowering What are the relevant codes or standards This question is in relation to steel pipelines for both gas and liquids,inzinjerstvo,104
119,I have recently been told that my salesmanship is lacking when it comes to getting my ideas implemented I receive the feedback that my ideas are sound and the data to implement is compelling and even that the ideas are presented in a way that management can understand but I am not doing a good job of selling the idea when it comes time to implement I feel a little odd about this because on the one hand I can understand that as an engineer I haven't honed this skill However on the other hand I feel almost blindsided that this is a skill I am expected to have; the decision-makers have already said go implement but when I go to implement the people with whom I am supposed to partner put up barriers to progress I'm wondering how others deal with this,inzinjerstvo,124
120,I've looked around for different types of concrete pump s and simply don't know if there are many different types what their mechanisms are and which ones are the most predominant ones What I've found This video explains how a pump with an S-shaped tube operates The relevant wikipedia page explains another type which does differ in the way how the concrete is released ( a concrete pump ),inzinjerstvo,123
121,How are spindle speeds calculated for a drill bit I've seen dozens of charts that highlight the rpm that should be used for specific drill bit types bit diameter and material However what if my chart doesn't have the particular type of material or bit that I am using I'd also like to have some intuition to know if the chart looks right or wrong Upon some quick research it appears that the cutting speed is what is ultimately needed for a particular material I assume the cutting speed for each material must be looked up Is there a standard or go-to place to find these Then information about the drill bit can be used to determine spindle speed Again what if I'm using a big hole saw or circle cutter and it's not listed How do I model the bit to use the cutting speed to determine rpm (for a given material of course) I'd also like to know to calculate feed speeds for a drill or mill but there are presumably more variables It is probably better answered in another question,inzinjerstvo,134
122,All of these theories are in use today and anyone can look up the definition of each theory in a textbook But what are the practical applications for each theory or said another way in what situations should one theory be preferred to the others Compilation of a general list would be most useful,inzinjerstvo,139

137,Given a tolerance within which your workpiece should be manufactured say some length should be $10\pm1$mm If you determine that your uncertainty in measuring this length is $0 2$mm (at 95%) How should a measurement of $9 1$mm be treated Clearly there is a significant probability that this value will actually be outside of tolerance Do you need to decrease you tolerance range based on the uncertainty in your measurement,inzinjerstvo,145
146,I want to quantify friction between a bullet and barrel to test different friction-proofing coatings and treatments Is there a controlled test I could do at low speeds in a lab between samples of treated copper and steel that would be theoretically applicable at velocities up to 1000 m/s I e is the dynamic coefficient of friction considered constant between two materials like copper and steel up to speeds of 1000 m/s or is there a known relationship between speed and friction that would allow extrapolation from lab-measured coefficients And what lab tests would be suited to measuring that coefficient to high precision (I realize that the most obvious way to approach this problem would be empirically i e just shoot the different projectiles and compare the resulting velocities I have tried that and gotten confusing results that appear to be attributable to the sources of error in internal ballistics in particular to the fact that different coatings are probably altering the diameter of the projectiles at the micron level and dimensional changes can overwhelm the changes in friction which render A-B comparisons invalid ),inzinjerstvo,149
150,As I heard the life expectancy of photovoltaic cells is normally some decades as so This is very long regarding their high cost it has significant (negative) effect on the total costs Why do they age I can see the only possibility which could damage their atomic structure and this is the very high energetic ultraviolet (or even soft röntgen) photon spectrum of the sun (which is only a small part of its power) And I think these photons could be maybe easily filtered out by a transparent plastic layer over the silicon Thus why do the solar cells age and what happens in them on the atomic level,inzinjerstvo,159
151,I think it could be a reactor utilizing californium-242 (or at least weapon-grade U-235) cooled and moderated by heavy water Essentially it were similar to an atomic bomb but - of course - it would be optimized for stay around the equilibrial state The result were probably a very strong neutron source I think it could be used for various things mainly in the space applications Does any cost/size estimations about this ever created,inzinjerstvo,192
160,I punch metals before I start a bit in them but with small-diameter bits I am finding that they wander inside the material E g drilling a 1/8 hole in 1/2 of aluminum the (titanium-coated HSS) bit will come out the other end a measurable distance to a side (orthogonal to the drill feed direction) from where it entered To be clear the bit starts where I want it to since I punched the metal But the bit appears to be flexing within the material causing the resulting hole to be angled How can I prevent this Is there something about the material that I need to understand in order to prevent the bit from wandering and causing the hole to be skewed I'd like to know the mechanics behind the materials that is causing these skewed holes,inzinjerstvo,161
162,I want to design a small wind turbine that can be easily carried out of the classroom into the sports field in relatively low-wind conditions (5-15km/h) that can power a small ultra-bright 5V LED - just enough to show that it works How do I calculate the power I can get from different blade diameters in these wind conditions and the power needed to drive a small DC motor/generator enough to light the LED,inzinjerstvo,164
165,Pontoon bridges differ from traditional bridges in that they are supported not by structures anchored to the floor of the body being spanned but by floating pontoons that are connected by a more rigid structure that supports a roadway They're often used by militaries to provide a temporary crossing point but they're also used for permanent civilian crossings I would assume that they make it easier to cross larger bodies of water because there is less structure to be secured below the surface In areas of deep water support structures can become unfeasibly large These larger spans could though make the pontoon bridges susceptible to damage from strong winds and currents Are there plans to use pontoon bridges to cross long distances,inzinjerstvo,177
166,By modern computers I mean electronic programmable computers such as those that were developed about the middle of the 20th century My understanding is that early computers such as Charles Babbage's calculating machines worked mainly on mechanical principles like a modern abacus Apparently later machines were more electronically based I'm talking about computers that evolved from using vacuum tubes to transistors to integrated circuits and ultimately silicon chips What engineering advances enabled the above transition to occur from physical means (e g vacuum tubes) to electronic means (e g transistors) when it did (middle 20th century),inzinjerstvo,167
170,I understand that you can have a device with angular measurements for rotation and elevation and use trigonometry to calculate the distances but only if you have some distances to start with How did they accurately measure the first straight-line distance over any distance significantly long enough to give usable angles And wouldn't the error in other distances calculated from this very quickly accumulate out of control,inzinjerstvo,173
171,The product is an electronic product with many subsystems Over 100 parametric tests were done follow by many functional tests The parametric test includes tri temperature testing as well as maximum nominal and minimum input DC supply voltage The DUT’s were manufactured at the same time and all the DUT’s have the same software The parametric tests have maximum and minimum limits There is not much leverage with respect to additional resource or time line extensions What would be an efficient method to root cause the validation test failures and develop corrective action plan for the product failures How can six sigma for continuous improvement help to efficiently identify failures,inzinjerstvo,174
179,The Eurocodes gives the following equation for estimating a simply supported bridge subject to bending only * $$n_0 = \frac{17 75}{\sqrt{\delta_0}}$$ Where $n_0$ is the natural frequency in hertz $\delta_0$ is the deflection at mid-span under permanent actions in mm The equation is seemly plucked from thin air and there is no explanation as to where the constant 17 75 comes from As an engineer I'm loath to use a formula I don't understand but more than that it would be helpful to learn the fundamentals behind it so that I can see if it can be altered to work with other support conditions Can anyone provide a derivation / fundamental origin to this relationship *Full reference is EN 1991-2 2003 6 4 4 [Note 8] (Equation 6 3) if that helps,inzinjerstvo,388
180,I'm working on design of a 3D movement drive (for 3D printers/CNC mills etc) using DC motors and helical drive A DC motor drives the leadscrew actuator which supports the working elements (head table or head bridge) The current of the motor shaft -> position of the driven element is read with optical encoder (I can derive speed acceleration momentum etc from that ) I can read the current (voltage across a fixed low resistance in series with the motor) and the voltage across the motor terminals resulting in measurement of the power -> torque I can drive the power supplied to the motor through PWM For optimal drive I should maintain movement speed as close as possible to given (right for the used machining parameters) and as I'm machining material the resistance of the material against the tool will change in more or less unexpected pattern This is pretty simple with stepper motors where we just assume the output directly follows the input In case of DC motor though the control must be much more reactive increasing power as torque rises What control algorithm would allow me to maintain movement speed closest to preset - meeting the additional condition restricting or rapidly minimizing exceeding the preset speed; rapidly reduced load as the head exits material could result in speed increase and drive the head into a neighbour element damaging the work piece (please note this is one of the questions that take long rather than short answers; control algorithms in automatics is a subject of good several semesters of study and choosing and explaining the control algorithm meeting specified criteria is bound to require some work ),inzinjerstvo,181
183,I am working on rub induced vibrations in compressor stages of aircraft engines The work is carried out in partnership with a company therefore there is a limited amount of it that could be published openly Do OpenSource compressor or turbine blade designs exist (e g NACA airfoil profiles for wings) Could you provide detailed dimensions --in particular for the cross-section profiles and stacking laws--- as well as the associated material properties The idea would be to use it for publication purposes thus displaying relevant characteristics and realistic behaviors from an engineering perspective while sharing all geometry and material property details so that other researchers may reproduce the published results,inzinjerstvo,184
186,There are numerous steel alloys containing mostly iron carbon and some other metals Generally speaking we can think of them as if they were some type of steel My question is do non-ferrous steels exist I am thinking of pure non-iron metals containing a little carbon just as is added to iron to turn it into steel Or asked another way are there other metals besides iron that are doped with carbon in order to form an alloy like steel In general how does the addition of carbon affect the properties of these metals,inzinjerstvo,189
191,As I know a very considerable part of the currently processed steels (around half of it) is coming from recycling But during the steels coming into the recycling process are coming normally from various sources and thus they are containing very different alloying materials But the output of the reprocessed steel must be steel containing alloys exactly in the specified ratios Do some type of separation or removal of the previous alloys of the recycled steel happen And if yes how does it work,inzinjerstvo,529
193,Consider a large auditorium a church or some other very large essentially one roomed building with a high ceiling Suppose that the building has many entrances which enable cold air in/hot air out and traffic in and out of the building is unavoidably large I would imagine that any attempts to control the temperature of such a large building would be very inefficient in terms of energy and cost particularly because warm air rises Assuming that it's very cold outside and we're interested primarily in keeping the building warm at the ground level so that it is comfortable for humans to work and interact what is the best method to keep such a large essentially one roomed building with a high ceiling warm when outdoor cold air exposure is frequent and unavoidable When I say best i'm interested in balancing energy maintenance and monetary costs over the life of the building,inzinjerstvo,194

207,Disclaimer I'm an applied mathematician by training not an engineer My work research primarily focuses on creating new methods to solve different PDE's related to solid deformation (elasticity) and fluid mechanics In this sense i know how to solve a pde problem computationally From my perspective engineers use my work as tools to accomplish their work However due to my lack of education/experience in engineering i admit i'm actually rather clueless on how numerical solutions to pde's are really used in an engineers actual practice The primary source of my confusion is the following I've been told that engineers never (or should never) conduct numerical simulations (e g finite element analysis CFD etc ) without knowing or having a good idea ahead of time what the simulation should look like This helps engineers discriminate realistic results from questionable ones However i argue that if the engineer already knows what is supposed to happen in the simulation then what's the point of simulation in the first place I've always assumed that simulations are needed for predictive purposes which assumes ignorance of what is to come That is I think of a simulation as a stand-alone tool to predict the future when you don't know what to expect What i'm looking for is a broader perspective into how/when/why engineers use numerical simulations like CFD and Finite Element Analysis especially if good engineering practice dictates that you should already know what to expect when you're simulating,inzinjerstvo,208
211,These days most of modern electronics use rechargeable batteries as a power source Also these days most modern rechargeable batteries are Lithium Ion or Lithium Polymer based Like any other devices over time these rechargeable batteries lose the ability to recharge retain and discharge energy thus users have to replace the devices or rechargeable batteries It is my understanding that the rise in battery internal resistance is the primary cause the rechargeable battery aging Is this accurate If so what can be done to lower or eliminate the internal resistance in rechargeable batteries If my understanding is inaccurate what is the cause for rechargeable battery aging If the causes for battery aging are understood how can electronic engineers design charging and discharging circuits to extend the rechargeable battery life References Battery University,inzinjerstvo,222

214,Austenite is non magnetic while $\alpha$-ferrite and pearlite are magnetic ( Magnetic properties of pearlite vary as a function of carbon content ) If a strong magnetic field is applied in a particular direction while the steel is being quenched (rather austenite is being quenched ) would the grain structure change Is it possible to get superior grain structure and hence tougher steel by application of cyclic magnetic field My speculation is that at the eutectoid point while quenching the steel as low carbon zone of pearlite has more permeability that zone should align itself to the strong magnetic field by pushing the carbon in orthogonal direction so grain boundaries should take a different shape Will it actually happen,inzinjerstvo,252

217,If I install a small air compressor/engine generator and tank in my garage and I charge it up at night when electricity costs $\frac{5 4p}{kWh}$ and use it during the day to power my house when electricity costs $\frac{12 5p}{kWh}$ would this be able to save money on the electricity bill or not The tank engine and generator should be sized to charge up over 7 hours between 01 00 and 08 00 and release the energy during the other 17 hours of the day I'm assuming that regardless of when during the day the energy is actually released it is either used by me or goes back into the grid and runs the meter backwards to offset my day-usage,inzinjerstvo,220
218,I was looking at high pressure pipes and their pressure ratings I'd like to know how these pressure ratings are determined I assume that pipes are tested until failure and the failure pressure is multiplied by some safety factor to determine its 'rated' pressure but is there a formula to calculate what the failure pressure should be before testing it (based on the material wall thickness diameter or other measurements of the pipe),inzinjerstvo,221
223,Weight lifters will use the term one rep maximum in order to refer to the maximum amount of weight that they can lift one time The one rep max is often used as a proxy for how strong someone is (or isn't) Recreational lifters other types of athletes and the general population rarely bother with testing themselves in order to determine their maximum strength From a human factors and usability point of view it can be useful to know what the average maximum strength of a population is so that design can take those limitations into account Please see the footnotes 1 2 3 for some practical applications of this question My question is if it's possible to estimate a person's maximum strength for a given activity by seeing how many repetitions they can complete at a lower weight For example if someone can bench-press 100 lbs 10 times in a row can that be used to estimate the maximum amount they could bench-press once If so does that estimation model hold consistently across activity types hold consistently across increasing amounts of weight hold consistently across age and gender distributions 1 An entertaining example amusement park / carnival attractions can be designed differently in order to accommodate the various distributions of strength 2 A mobility example aids for the disabled can be enhanced if it's found that their maximum strength is below the threshold for a device 3 A diagnostics example restraints can be designed just to the maximum of a particular demographic's abilities in order to provide a more comforting or friendly appearance This provides a humanizing touch while maintaining the accuracy of the diagnostic test,inzinjerstvo,225
224,Cut-in cut-out thermostats are commonly used with refrigeration devices in order to hold a consistent temperature range Their general operations is such that when the temperature by the probe reaches a particular temperature set as the upper limit the thermostat cuts-in and the compressor is turned on providing cold air And when the temperature by the probe reaches the lower temperature set point the thermostat cuts-out and turns off the compressor What materials are used in within an analog or mechanical cut-in cut-out thermostat Likewise how is the internal circuit designed such that one probe feeds both cut circuits and what control is put in place for the cut-out to override the cut-in signal To help scope this question based upon the materials used in an analog cut-in cut-out thermostat would it be reasonable to attempt to test and adjust the set points of a thermostat by using jars of water at known temperatures and measuring the output off of the relay within the thermostat,inzinjerstvo,228
226,Some dc motors can be used as generators as well by applying mechanical torque to the output shaft to induce a current However even if a dc motor can do this I imagine they were not designed for this purpose and thus perform less efficiently when used as a generator rather than as a motor In my admittedly naive understanding dc generators and dc motors are essentially the same machinery but with inputs and outputs reversed This leads me to believe that some other design considerations are used to make one direction more efficient than the other How differently are dc generators and dc motors designed to make one direction of input/output more efficient than the other What can one do electrically or mechanically to improve the efficiency in either direction In particular I'm interested in converting a dc motor into a generator and want to know how I can improve its efficiency in converting mechanical energy into electrical energy,inzinjerstvo,451

231,I want to do some very simplified drag calculations on a vessel My hope was that calculating the skin-friction resistance would be enough to get a good estimate of the surge resistance Because wave-making resistance is very speed dependent I assume you can neglect it when the vessel is below a certain speed I also assume that I have to work with Froude numbers instead of velocities to take vessel size into account I have seen Froude numbers below Fn = 0 1 and Fn = 0 2 mentioned in books and on the Internet but if you calculate the velocity for a vessel with a 100 m long waterline you get $$V = 0 1 \cdot \sqrt{9 81\ \text{m/s}^2 \cdot 100\ \text{m}} \approx 3 13\ \text{m/s} \approx 6 08\ \text{knots}$$ $$V = 0 2 \cdot \sqrt{9 81\ \text{m/s}^2 \cdot 100\ \text{m}} \approx 6 26\ \text{m/s} \approx 12 16\ \text{knots}$$ This values seem way too high in my opinion 12 16 knots is almost service speed for some vessels and 6 knots is also quite high Are Fn = 0 1 and Fn = 0 2 reasonable numbers and if not below what Froude numbers should I stay to be able to neglect wave-making resistance,inzinjerstvo,288

245,I have a beam subject to twisting and/or bending forces as well as linear compression force along its main axis It is modelled as an isotropic beam but if anisotropic is not too far off then that's okay too The beam is capable of large deformations such that its maximum deformations are 140 degrees in pure bending 140 degrees in pure twisting 70 degrees bending + 70 degrees twisting What is an applicable nonlinear beam theory I can apply to this problem using equations rather than any software-based solutions I like using the basic undergrad Euler-Bernoulli beam theory but the assumptions make it invalid in this case and I'm looking for something that is in the same vein as far as calculations goes and does not require significantly more advanced mathematics Ideally a theory that reduces the problem to a set of equations that can be solved without requiring multiple pages of tensor calculations that are hard to follow,inzinjerstvo,333
251,When designing reinforced concrete slabs it is common to divide the slab into 'design strips' which are then used to rationalise the reinforcement design along (typically orthogonal) lengths of the slab (also known as the Hilleborg Strip Method) I have mostly seen this approach used in design software (for example SAFE) however they offer little to no advice as to how and where these design strips should be located/sized What rules and considerations do engineers apply when locating/sizing design strips,inzinjerstvo,1831
253,As an example consider a P-T1-system with a PID-controller First look only at the P-T1 system set a $y_r$ and wait a long time - then we take a look on its output $x$ and see that it has still a disturbance $d$ which variates with time (see the plot system output $= x$) In this model the system output is after you wait a long time a constant plus $d(t)$ The next step is to introduce a PID-controller For this loop alone we could just use some experience-based technique like the Ziegler and Nichols procedure to adjust its parameters $K_p$ $K_i$ and $K_d$ optimally If we switch to discrete control loop because the controller is digital we will have one additional parameter The $\Delta t$ at which the controller operates What $\Delta t$ is required for the control loop to diminish the effects of $d$ on the system output The trend will of course be the smaller $\Delta t$ the better but is there a general rule for the maximum $\Delta t$,inzinjerstvo,512

280,For a project I had built a convergent divergent nozzle designed for Mach number = 3 In that project I could know the flow has gone supersonic by seeing the manometer fixed between the throat and the divergent section (drop in pressure as the divergent section acts like a nozzle for the supersonic flow) However this got me thinking If I am to build a nozzle for the propulsion purpose (or any practical purpose) it is not desirable to have holes in it for the manometer in order to maintain the uniform strength My theoretical calculations tell me that the flow should go supersonic and no shock in the nozzle but while building the surface finish geometric tolerances and supply pressure might not be what I expect In that case how do I know if the flow has gone supersonic I thought about following ways So far I haven't tried any of them Using a Pitot tube might not be useful since there will be a bow shock in front of the tube if in case the flow is indeed supersonic (as shown in the figure) which will increase the total pressure We can use Reyleigh pitot tube formula but how to compute static free stream pressure without affecting the flow / nozzle Schlieren Photography If we see oblique shocks / shock diamonds then the inference will be 'flow is supersonic' This will work only when the shock features are super clear,inzinjerstvo,294
283,A friend and I wrote a paper for a fluids class discussing the details (as they relate to fluid dynamics) of constructing a cannon that could shoot a steak fast enough to cook it We quickly discovered (but not quickly enough to change our topic) that our paper was a bit too ambitious for two twenty year old undergrads taking an introductory course in fluid mechanics Nonetheless we still busted out a ballistics simulator a cookbook and a compressive heating calculator and did our best One of the issues that stumped us was compressing the gas we used to launch the steak We chose Helium because it was the least dense gas that probably won't burst into flames (like Hydrogen) Using a compressive heating calculator we found the velocity we needed to shoot the steak and were using Bernoulli's equation to find the pressure we needed to launch at our chosen velocity The issue we ran into was density is dependent on pressure but we needed the density to calculate the pressure needed How does one determine the pressure given the issue above Is it simply several rounds of iteration until an acceptable answer is found,inzinjerstvo,286
289,The modern LED bulbs you can get must convert the standard household supply (for example $240\text{v AC}$ in the UK) into a DC supply at a lower voltage (usually $12\text{v DC}$ I think) for the LED array This is done on a per-bulb basis Does this waste much power in the conversion If all of your bulbs are LED bulbs would it make sense instead to have a $12\text{v DC}$ circuit for lighting around the whole house and LED bulbs without the per-bulb conversion,inzinjerstvo,291
298,This is inspired by a project I undertook for my Physics class last year; I'd like to apply it in the future Background For the project I and a few classmates were required to build a small car powered by any of a number of sources; we opted for a mousetrap that turned two rear wheels on a four-wheel car as it was released Our group's goal was to make the car go as far as possible One problem was that the power source was not constant The lever arm of the trap lifted in an arc for about five seconds then returned to its resting position During this time it propelled the car The car then coasted for the rest of the way In the powered stage we wanted to increase traction The wheels were CDs (because we had a $5 00 budget) which have a tendency to spin out So we attached pieces of cloth to them to get better traction On the second stage however we found that this cloth slowed down the car quite a bit because it dramatically increased friction (as we found out after several hours of testing different combinations) Other groups used duct tape to cover the wheels and some used records which seemed to do slightly better than CDs (though that violated the size restrictions) Cloth seemed to have the best traction though - we didn't have many spinouts The tests were done on a typical classroom floor (I'm not sure what it's made of - linoleum - but it's the same as in almost every school at least in America) In a wheeled vehicle in general - obviously not just a small car powered by a mousetrap - how can I substantially improve traction on the wheels while the power source is on yet reduce friction while it coasts Is it as simple as choosing certain tires or is there a bigger and better engineering solution As a final wrap-up My thought would be to have a shifting center of mass for the vehicle where the powered wheels have a lesser tendency to slip and the front wheels are nearly frictionless During the powered stage the center of mass would be near the back while in the coasting stage it would be near the front This could help reduce the normal force on certain wheels and thereby produce or avoid extra friction,inzinjerstvo,301

303,(This is closely linked with measuring the Mach number inside a nozzle but it is not regarding the supersonic flow) Friction and heat transfer have effects on the Mach number of the compressible flow ( Fanno and Rayleigh flow ) As it is extremely important to have tight control over the flow properties here are my questions - how does one know the Mach number of the flow inside long pipelines carrying some sort of gas (e g WEPP ) What Mach number is maintained through these pipelines Considering the cyclic temperature changes and friction inside the pipes how is the Mach number maintained constant / within a range,inzinjerstvo,334

313,I live in Louisiana these days in an area that is known for its numerous antebellum plantation homes (circa early 1800s) While touring one of these homes it was clear that almost everything about the house was designed around keeping cool in the summer Some examples 4-meter-high ceilings to allow hot air to rise to the ceiling Floor-to-ceiling windows to allow hot air at the top to escape and cool air to be drawn in at the bottom Porches on the sunny sides of the house to prevent sunlight from entering the windows Large central staircases to allow hot air to rise to the second floor drawing cool air in on the bottom floor Some have a cupola a central observation room at the top of the house again to allow hot air to escape at the top of the house and draw air in from the bottom My question is Given our modern understanding of thermodynamics how could one design a home today to be cooled passively Could we do any better than the plantation owners of the 1800s Let's define cooling as making the house more comfortable for humans This means that it is not only important to reduce the temperature but also to block sunlight and maintain airflow Also if possible it would be very beneficial to extract moisture from the air,inzinjerstvo,319

336,Many commercial and open-source CFD codes implement several closure methods for the non-linear convective acceleration term of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations Common methods (also known as turbulence models ) include Spalart–Allmaras (S–A) k–? (k–epsilon) k–? (k–omega) SST (Menter’s Shear Stress Transport) Reynolds stress equation model Which of these are suitable for CFD simulation of a streamlined vehicle body The purpose of the simulations is to guide the refinement of the body shape to minimize aerodynamic drag forces An exemplary answer would briefly outline the advantages and disadvantages of each method for this simulation application Potentially useful details The vehicle is a small one-person vehicle with approximate dimensions L = 2 5 m W = 0 7 m and H = 0 5 m It will be travelling at speeds ranging from 0 m/s to approximately 12 m/s All three wheels are enclosed by the body envelope and the vehicle has an approximate ground clearance of 15 cm except near the wheels where the body shell extends down to within 1 cm of the road surface Normally aerodynamic forces at these speeds are very nearly negligible but assume that this vehicle is being designed to compete in a Super Mileage competition on a smooth track is very light-weight and uses low friction drivetrain components throughout so the aerodynamic forces have a significant effect on the achievable fuel consumption,inzinjerstvo,344

397,Various materials are implanted within the human body as a result of of medical need Dental implants stabilizing plates arterial stents and orthopedic replacements are all common examples where a material is implanted within the body The typical response of the immune system to any foreign body is to attack the implant If the immune system cannot eradicate the foreign body then it attempts to encapsulate it instead This self-preserving attack from the immune system can lead to implant failure and the likelihood of failure is in part dependent upon the bio-reactivity of the material For example stainless steel has been evaluated to be less reactive than more base steel alloys and titanium has been found to be less reactive than stainless steel How is bio-reactivity characterized and how is it measured over the conditions of a long term implantation,inzinjerstvo,398

406,It's not exactly my area of expertize and I've spent a couple hours ears deep in norms and I'm not really sure if what I found is correct (the figure I found was to the order of 1$\mu$m) When using standard (off-the-shelf not specialized) threaded pin / bolt and a matching nut for a lead-screw actuator what degree of imprecision (free lengthwise movement of the actuator without the shaft turning) can I expect coming from the allowed technical tolerances of the thread In other words what amount of play can I expect between a threaded bolt and nut To be more specific I realize there will be movement from lateral and longitudinal flexibility of the shaft; from its mounting bearings; from its axial twist against the drive; and probably quite a few other sources but I'd like to know this specific factor - how much of a give or play can there be in a thread allowing movement of the nut along the bolt without either of them turning I suspect that this changes with the shaft diameter so a table or a method to calculate the amount of play for most common metric threads would be preferred for an answer If that's too difficult or doesn't exist I'm most interested in the value for M10 thread,inzinjerstvo,418

420,I'd like to build an exploratory robot that can fit within confined spaces 1 What traction mechanisms should I consider to propel a robot along the inside of a 4 pipe The pipe to be traversed will likely have fluid (assume water) within it to varying degrees from partially full to completely full I'm initially planning on tethering the robot with coaxial cable So far I have considered a 3 and 4 point wheeled approach such as with a Y or X configuration of wheels And I have considered treads instead of wheels The robot will need to be able to navigate 90 o turns on the way in but can be hauled out via the coaxial cable if need be Preferably it will be able to back its way out for the majority of the distance it can cover The robot would not need to climb unassisted The initial use will be in a pipe that drops several feet from the access point and then slopes down approximately 5 feet over a 60 foot run Retrieving the robot will be assisted by the coaxial cable or a tether line 1 It's a rather boring application actually I want to see how badly the roots are creeping into the sewer line from my house,inzinjerstvo,434

433,I'd like to build an exploratory robot that can fit within confined spaces 1 As the robot moves along the inside of a 4 pipe it's likely to encounter some obstacles that need to be removed Typically that will be tree roots up to 1/2 thick There could also be globs of tissue paper caught by the roots The majority of the pipe is made from clay but a small portion of the pipe is cast iron The portion that has the obstacles is clay and was laid in the early 1960's The pipe to be traversed will likely have fluid (assume water) within it to varying degrees from partially full to completely full I'm initially planning on tethering the robot with coaxial cable and possibly an additional line like a steel cable The propulsion mechanism is still being defined but I expect that the robot will have some ability to fix itself in place while clearing out an obstacle The typical way of removing roots and other obstacles is through using a drain cleaning system The cutting head is usually a pronged piece of metal that can burrow through the obstacle The problem with this approach is that the pipe is damaged as part of the cleaning process and some amount of roots are left behind Another commercial approach that completely clears the line utilizes a spinning wire brush The downside of this approach is that pipe wall is severely damaged as part of the cleaning I would like to devise a cutting mechanism that doesn't significantly damage the pipe but also removes the majority of the obstacles encountered What type of cutting shearing grinding etc mechanism should I consider in order to clear out the path in front of the robot as it explores the line 1 It's a rather boring application actually I want to see how badly the roots are creeping into the sewer line from my house Ideally I'd like to clear out the roots too without damaging the clay pipe,inzinjerstvo,1811

472,I have a liquid circuit which looks a bit like that The system is under suction and the flow rate through each unit should be about 10ml/min However we noticed that unit n and the ones the furthest away from the pump and bottle were not getting enough flow Any suggestions on how to make sure each unit gets about the same amount of flow My initial thought was to add a second pump at the end of the line to help the liquid (water) go round the circuit Another possibility is to separate the load of n units into 2 circuits in parallel 1 to n/2 and n/2 + 1 to n at the bottle/pump location so that both circuits will have a better chance of seeing the same amount of liquid Some precisions there is a restrictor on the return path of each unit to restrict the flow and create a pressure differential to allow the liquid to go round the length from unit #1 to unit #n is about 3m the pump and bottle are located between unit #4 and #5 the tubing diameter along that length is 4 8mm ID and each teed off line in each unit is 1 6mm ID with the restrictor 0 38mm ID (~60mm length) the pump is a diaphragm liquid pump there is a vent port with a filter on the bottle lid to allow for the pressure to vent out,inzinjerstvo,473
475,When using weathering steel (COR-TEN) on a project what sort of bolts should I be using I have yet to see fixings made of weather steel; presumably because the way it uses a sacrificial layer to form a protective rust coating makes it unsuitable for precision applications (such as bolt threads; maintaining the structural area etc ) I am also aware that mixing different metals; even various steel alloys can lead to accelerated corrosion due to anodic/cathodic behaviour So what type of bolts should be specified with weathering steel,inzinjerstvo,476

538,I want to look at the thermal heat plume of a human in still air in a room So I have a tank of water with a heating coil/cylinder in it How do I calculate what the heat output of my heating coil will need to be in order to mimic that of a human's ($100W$) in air This is based on dimensional similarity between water air Reynolds' number and Reyleigh number The Rayleigh number which governs buoyancy is given by $\dfrac{g\beta}{\nu \alpha \kappa}q x^4$ where $\alpha=$ thermal diffusivity $\beta=$ thermal expansion coefficient $\kappa=$ thermal conductivity $\nu=$ kinematic viscosity $x$= distance from the heated surface But I don't really understand if the Rayleigh number is the right value to be attempting to maintain similar between both scenarios Any help would be much appreciated EDIT So using the Q* formula to get similarity between the two media $\dfrac{Q_{air}}{\left(\rho C_pT_{\infty}g^{1/2}x\right)_{air}}=\dfrac{Q_{water}}{\left(\rho C_pT_{\infty}g^{1/2}x\right)_{water}}$ and rearranging to get Q_water $Q_{water}=Q_{air}\dfrac{\left(\rho C_pT_{\infty}g^{1/2}x\right)_{water}}{\left(\rho C_pT_{\infty}g^{1/2}x\right)_{air}}$ Then substituting in AIR $\rho=1 225kg/m^3$ $C_p=1 005kJ/kg\ K$ $T_{\infty}=21^{\circ}C$ $x=0 1m$ $Q_{air}=100W$ WATER $\rho=1000kg/m^3$ $C_p=4 19kJ/kg\ K$ $T_{\infty}=8^{\circ}C$ $x=0 1m$ $Q_{air}= W$ I get $Q_{water}\simeq 1 2\times10^4W$ But this seems much too high Can this be right,inzinjerstvo,547
548,I'm a bit confused about all the different definitions of uncertainty One can calculate uncertainty of a single measurement by simply checking how accurate the tool that is being used to do the measuring is One can also calculate uncertainty of a group of measurements by finding the standard deviation which means that any more measurements made will have a 70% chance of being within one standard deviation of the true value Finally there is also standard error which is also a measure of uncertainty but I'm not sure what it says Which uncertainty do I have to find in the following problem and would I go about finding it A particular 1 00-kg bag of rice consists of 2 00% supergrains each of which contains 5ppm of arsenic and the rest of the grains contain no arsenic What is the average concentration A grain of rice weighs 20 mg What is the uncertainty in the concentration due to sampling if a 10 00 g sample is taken for analysis from this bag If the entire contents of the bag were ground to spherical particles 100 micrometer in diameter what would the uncertainty be if a 10 0 g sample were taken for analysis The first part is pretty straight forward I calculated that the average concentration of arsenic in this bag of rice is 100ppb It's the next two questions I don't understand partly because as I said in the beginning I'm not sure what definition of uncertainty they are asking for/about How would I go about finding it Please correct any assumptions or definitions I've made if they are incorrect in any way I'm really trying to learn and I know how important precision of language is,inzinjerstvo,553

572,Anyone used to doing housework has probably noticed that vacuum cleaners come in both bagged and bagless varieties If you're of a certain age you may have noticed when these bagless vacuums appeared back in the 1990s Though I didn't recognize it at the time these bagless vacuums are an example of a technology I would later study in my undergraduate career called cyclonic separation This article from The Guardian talks a bit about the Dyson company's introduction and application of cyclone technology in vacuum cleaners and makes the claim that the newest models separate even the smallest of particles without filtration (i e entirely by cyclonic separation) Given my experience with cyclones this is quite an impressive claim Though widely used to deal with coarse and medium-coarse particles industrial cyclones are typically incapable of removing fine particulates including many of the allergens that Dyson claims their vacuums now remove without additional filtration of the exhaust * In the area of air pollution control cyclones are often regarded as pre-treatment devices for this reason and because they are more durable and cost less to operate and maintain than e g baghouses wet scrubbers or electrostatic precipitators What makes this even more impressive to me is that these vacuums are portable; not only do they move around as you clean the body of the vacuum tilts up and down In handheld applications from what I understand they can even be inverted I don't understand how a cyclone would continue to function in this situation I would expect a sharp drop in control efficiency (or in plain terms a lot of dust in the exhaust) For example my fourth edition copy of Air Pollution Control A Design Approach (Cooper &amp; Alley 2011) describes cyclones exclusively in terms of a fixed vertical orientation Typically a particulate-laden gas enters tangentially near the top of the cyclone The gas flow is forced into a downward spiral Centrifugal force and intertia cause the particles to move outward collide with the outer wall and then slide downward to the bottom of the device (p 135) In this configuration gravity causes the separated particles to fall into the hopper where they are segregated from the air stream and can later be removed This EPA inspection course handbook shows three inlet configurations (two tangential and one axial); in each case the contaminant falls downward into the hopper under the influence of gravity Wikipedia cites an article describing horizontally-oriented cyclones utilizing a powerful secondary air stream to direct collected material toward the collection hopper something that is not included in the traditional vertical design The article includes the following illustration Every industrial cyclone I've seen in the wild has been configured vertically—in fact I had never heard of a horizontal cyclone before researching this question In either case the dimensions of the device must be carefully determined to provide optimal collection; the Cooper &amp; Alley book gives the following theoretical equation for the diameter d p of,inzinjerstvo,1942

600,I've attempted to answer the following question and I need to know if I am on the right track LOGIC GATES Question 3 A manufacturing plant uses two tanks to store certain liquid chemicals that are required in a manufacturing process Each tank has a sensor that detects when the chemical level drops to 25% of full The sensors produce a HIGH level of 5V when the tanks are more than one-quarter full When the volume of chemical in a tank drops to one-quarter full or less the sensor puts out a LOW level of 0V It is required that a single green light-emitting diode (LED) on an indicator panel shows when both tanks are less than one quarter full 3 1 Show the truth table 3 2 Derive the Boolean expressions 3 3 Show how 3 NAND gates can be used to implement this (Consider the wording very carefully in this question) It's question 3 1 and 3 2 The last sentence of the main question is a bit tricky It says Show when both tanks are less than 1/4 full Here is my solution Both inputs (namely Tank A and Tank B) need to be LOW in order to indicate a LOW output The only logic circuit to satisfy the above is an OR circuit 0 + 0 = 0; 0 + 1 = 1; 1 + 0 = 1; 1 + 1 = 1 From the above I believe OR operations is correct since A and B are both LOW and thus causing the output to be low I was considering AND Circuit but then 0 x 1 = 0 and 1 x 0 = 0 These operations conflict with the question The output must only show LOW when BOTH inputs are LOW Therefore my solution for 3 1 and 3 2 would be using an OR gate Is that correct,inzinjerstvo,606

617,My understanding is that cavitation occurs in the flow of a liquid when the static pressure drops below the vapor pressure even intermittently So even if the time-averaged static pressure (what you might measure) is above the vapor pressure the pressure fluctuations from turbulence or other unsteadiness could be large enough to cause cavitation locally So comparing the time-averaged static pressure against the vapor pressure isn't enough; you need to add some extra cushion to account for the pressure fluctuations (This is my interpretation not having read too deeply into this ) So in various books websites and journal articles I have seen two different types of dimensionless numbers for estimating whether the flow through a valve or nozzle cavitates They are generally called the cavitation index or cavitation number They take one of two forms $$\sigma = \frac{p_\text{in} - p_\text{vapor}}{p_\text{in} - p_\text{out}}$$ or $$\sigma = \frac{p_\text{in} - p_\text{vapor}}{\tfrac{1}{2} \rho V^2}$$ where $p_\text{in}$ is the inlet pressure $p_\text{out}$ is the outlet pressure $p_\text{vapor}$ is the vapor pressure $\rho$ is the liquid density and $V$ is some characteristic velocity of the flow (say in the nozzle case the velocity at the outlet) Some forms of this number are inversions of the numbers above but these aren't that different What is the difference between these parameters Based on energy conservation you can relate the pressure drop to the flow rate but typically there is an empirical coefficient added in to account for non-idealities Is there something else I am missing Is one form preferred over the other Best I can tell whether to use one or the other depends on what sort of data you have (so for flow over a turbine blade the velocity form is preferred) but I've seen both even for nozzles Where can I get accurate data to predict cavitation based on these numbers I've tried using some data on atomizer nozzles from various journal articles but generally they use different forms of the cavitation number Some of the data suggests the flow through the nozzle will cavitate at the pressures I want but other data for similar nozzles suggests it won't I'm not sure what the source of the inconsistency is My understanding could be faulty the cavitation number model could be too simplistic the data could be inaccurate etc,inzinjerstvo,626

686,I have a chicken coop I plan on modifying to automatically open and close the door at dawn and dusk What sort of actuator or mechanism would be appropriate for operating the small side-hinged door Constant power is not available (solar) plus it needs enough holding force to keep foxes out,inzinjerstvo,689
687,I have a brazed plate heat exchanger similar to these I can regulate flow and temperature of water on the primary side of the exchanger to achieve the desired temperature of water on secondary side The desired temperature and flow on the secondary side are not under my control How do I optimize the flow and temperature on the primary side so that I get the lowest possible temperature for water exiting the heat exchanger while still achieving the desired temperature on the secondary side Note The transfer medium is chemically treated water the maximum temperature is around 100 °C at 4 bar If I increase the flow to some maximum value I will also increase the heat loss through the pipe walls However increasing the flow rate would allow me to lower the supply temperature which decreases the heat loss How would I calculate the best flow rate and supply temperature combination to minimize heat loss through the pipe walls,inzinjerstvo,704
693,Suppose I have a sealed enclosure say this one from Hoffman The box is 16 x12 x6 made of galvanized steel with a wall thickness of 0635 or 0785 (gauge 16 or 14) I'm planning to put some electronics in this box which will generate an arbitrary amount of heat How can I use this information to estimate how much the air inside the box will heat up above ambient outside the box,inzinjerstvo,700
703,I am working on a hand-held prototype model in which I need to fix motor RPM below a certain displacement For example if overall displacement is within 5 mm then the motor should be running at a fixed RPM After getting this done (I mean if displacement is > 5 mm) I wish to work on sensing the linear acceleration of the hand-held prototype I will use this data to control my motor's RPM again Typical hand-held displacement range would be around 5 cm to 30 cm in 2 sec Someone suggested to use IMUs to sense acceleration and rotation but I am not sure how to design my prototype to utilize an IMO How can I select an IMU and determine an appropriate sensitivity level References to relevant literature would be very helpful,inzinjerstvo,705
1705,My car has ultrasonic proximity sensors to help me park I've noticed that when motorcycles whiz past me the proximity alarm goes off I originally thought that the motorcycles were just too close but now I have observed that that isn't the case; cars or other road users at a similar distance and speed do not set off the sensors It doesn't seem to matter what speed I am traveling I am not interested in troubleshooting some aspect of the alarm I'm just trying to understand why this occurs What special characteristic of a motorcycle or its movement causes it to be detected by the sensors when other road users are not detected,inzinjerstvo,1727
1706,Bridges are designed for the loads that come from the vehicles that are expected to cross them This includes the weight the vehicle and any dynamic loads that may be introduced from movement of the vehicle Dynamic loads may be from bouncing or from hitting a joint or pothole Initially it would seem obvious that more load is applied to a bridge while the vehicles are in motion (weight of vehicle plus dynamic load) The dynamic loads are proportional to the travelling speed of the vehicles but as vehicles go faster they typically are spaced farther apart When vehicles are stopped they typically are much more closely spaced than when they are moving Can there be a situation where more load is on a bridge because of closely spaced parked vehicles than from moving vehicles that are farther apart Are these two situations covered in bridge design,inzinjerstvo,1723
1709,I'm giving SolidWorks a try and am following one of their tutorials on creating a part When I create circles they are looking a bit boxy to me My graphics card has 512MB of ram and I have checked the rendering settings that I found and everything seems to be OK - but I would have expected something more circular and less rough looking but I'm new to working with CAD - is this normal,inzinjerstvo,1711
