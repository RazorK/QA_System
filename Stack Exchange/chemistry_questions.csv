4001,It seems to me that the addition of electrons and protons as you move across a period would cause an atom to become larger However I'm told it gets smaller Why is this,hemija,4003
4002,My understanding is that $\mathrm{NaCl}$ is an ionic compound in which $\mathrm{Cl}$ becomes (effectively) $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ and $\mathrm{Na}$ becomes $\mathrm{Na^+}$ So I understand why I would get a sea of particles that would stick together But why does the above mean that it will have a face centered cubic structure with the ions held in place so rigidly,hemija,4056
4004,A reaction proceeds towards the direction of lesser Gibbs Free energy (at constant T and P) So we could say that Gibbs free energy at equilibrium is minimum On the other hand we have $$\Delta G=\Delta G^o + RT\ln Q$$ where $Q$ is the reaction quotient At equilibrium $Q=K_{eq}$ and we already know that $\Delta G^o=-RT\ln K_{eq}$ Substituting we get $\Delta G=0$ at equilibrium But we know that $G$ minimized itself--thus there was a change in $G$ and $\Delta G &lt; 0$ What am I missing here,hemija,4013
4007,When N N-dimethylaniline is reacted with $\ce{H_2SO_4}$ and $\ce{HNO_3}$ it gives mainly the meta product even though $\ce{NMe_2}$ is an ortho / para directing group Why is this,hemija,4012
4011,Recrystallization is a nice way of purifying a product but choosing a suitable solvent if you can't rely on the literature seems like a lot of trial-and-error Are there any general rules on which kind of solvents could be used for recrystallization Which criteria should one use when trying to recrystallize a compound for which no literature on useable conditions exists,hemija,4019
4016,I often hear that water gets purified by being in a silver vessel which sounds plausible because of bactericidal feature of silver What doesn't sound plausible though is the way it's explained that silver releases ions into the water Since silver is a noble metal why would any reaction at all occur with something as neutral as water Is the above explanation nonsense Does the disinfection of water happen only on contact with the metal,hemija,4022
4017,In environmental chemistry most of the organophosphorous compounds we worry about are actually organophosphate compounds Is there something about the $\mathrm{C-P}$ bond that makes it less stable (and thus less persistent in the environment) than a $\mathrm{C-O-P}$ bond,hemija,4090
4018,Organic compounds are typically defined as “molecules containing carbon” Wikipedia states that there for some historical (read non-logical) reasons a few types of carbon-containing compounds such as carbides carbonates simple oxides of carbon and cyanides as well as the allotropes of carbon such as diamond and graphite are considered inorganic I thus wonder is activated charcoal (also known as activated carbon) typically classified as an organic or inorganic material If I follow the list of exceptions given by Wikipedia it should be organic (it's not an allotrope of carbon in particular) but I get the feeling that most people in the field of porous materials would classify it as inorganic So I'm looking for an authoritative reference on this question,hemija,4065
4024,What software is available out there to calculate the equilibrium in a set of reactions in aqueous solution In particular I'm interested in software general enough to simulate things like titration curves involving acido-basicity complex formation precipitation… A web search turns up plenty of academic papers giving algorithms to find the equilibrium of such systems but I'd like to find software that actually performs it In particular it would be really helpful if there existed such software that included a decent database of reaction constants for some well-known reactions (pKa for common acide-base couples complexation and precipitation constants etc ) Edit Apparently I was unclear I'm not looking for molecular simulation codes but for software that can calculate chemical equilibrium in solution from initial concentrations and a database of equilibrium constants for each possible reaction The kind of thing teachers can use to predict titration curve and demonstrate the effect of various initial concentrations to students,hemija,4057
4025,How can one choose which group has more shifting tendency in 1 2 carbocation rearrangement The obvious order is via the stability of the carbocation of the group But phenylic groups have high shifting tendency--and a phenylic carbocation is unstable Is there a way of predicting these I was thinking that it will be related to the delocalization in the triangular intermediate formed Update I'm talking about comparing migratory aptitude of the $R$ groups in a system similar to $&gt;C(+)-C(R_1R_2R_3)$,hemija,4093
4026,The reagent APTES is a fairly common ink for microcontact printing a technique that forms covalent bonds between the silanols found on the surface of the glass and the silane in the the APTES It's also been demonstrated that the mono-layer then polymerizes somewhat forming bonds between neighboring silanols What is the mechanism by which the printing and polymerization occur and what is the reason for using APTES instead of a more reactive trichlorosilane,hemija,4233
4027,I've heard quite a few times that the chromate and permanganate have a $d^3s$ configuration Also their colors arise due to a rapid switching of electrons between the oxygen and metal atoms I don't really understand the 'rapid switching' part--it's obvious why it can give color but I fail to see why there is a need for such a switching-what's so special about $\mathrm{Cr}$ and $\mathrm{Mn}$ (I also do not know what the switching exactly is) An explanation of $d^3s$ would be appreciated though not necessary,hemija,4067
4029,The total synthesis of vitamin B-12 by Robert Burns Woodward and Albert Eschenmoser is over 30 years old At its time it was considered a landmark in the field With current developments (e g olefin metathesis palladium catalysis etc ) is it possible to optimize this synthesis By optimize I mean reduce the number of steps in the synthesis,hemija,4777
4030,It is known that impurities in a desired isolated product lower the melting point of the mixture even if the impurities melting point is much higher than the desired product Why is that,hemija,4034
4031,In a crystal structure I've determined a triazole ring on my ligand appears to be stacking with a tyrosine (top in picture) However there is also an amide courtesy a glutamine near it (bottom) Is it likely this terminal amide is engaging in &pi;-&pi; interactions with the triazole or just weaker dispersion forces How would I quantify how significant the interaction is,hemija,4038
4033,What conditions promote a nucleophile to undergo the Michael reaction over the nucleophilic attack at the alpha carbon of the carbonyl group in an alpha-beta-unsaturated ketone I'm looking for an answer that considers organic and inorganic nucleophiles (like organocuprates/organolithium compounds),hemija,4051
4045,One synthesis of quinolones begins with the formation of an ethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate as seen in this Organic Syntheses paper I've been asked if the malonate derivative would be formed if methylmalonate was treated with trimethyl orthoformate with a catalytic amount of $\mathrm{H^+}$ without heating The nature of the solvent isn't mentioned but I guess the reaction is carried out in a non-aqueous medium with an ion-exchange resin since I think trimethyl orthoformate acts as a water trap My hunch is that there shouldn't be a significant quantity of product formed We're dealing with an activated methylene why not simply use a base and then carry on with our addition I can't imagine how under normal circumstances the elimination product ethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate will be formed How can this reaction happen in a mechanistically reasonable way,hemija,4362
4046,This question on NaCl crystalization actually got me wondering are there any ionic amorphous solids Like ionic crystals are crystalline materials of electrostatically-attracted ions can ions form an amorphous phase I can see no reason why not but I cannot think of any example either…,hemija,4055
4054,Many of us have experienced the failure of nitrile gloves when exposed to chloroform What's going on at a mechanistic level when this occurs I would guess that the chloroform dissolves some of the polymer into its constituent monomers but I've never heard anything more definite than that Is it a similar mechanism to what happens when chloroform is left too long in a plastic bottle,hemija,4435
4062,In the hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds with hydrogen gas and a catalyst the choice of palladium on carbon is able to hydrogenate alkenes and alkynes but is unable to hydrogenate aromatic compounds Using rhodium or Raney nickel however allows one to hydrogenate aromatics How does the choice of catalyst affect what kind of unsaturated compounds can be hydrogenated,hemija,4104
4063,The most notable characteristic of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE DuPont's Teflon) is that nothing sticks to it This complete inertness is attributed to the fluorine atoms completely shielding the carbon backbone of the polymer If nothing indeed sticks to Teflon how might one coat an object (say a frying pan) with PTFE,hemija,4075
4064,Solvent extraction in a separation funnel is a very common method in preparative organic chemistry But sometimes you don't get a nice phase separation between the organic and the water phase What are the possible causes that can prevent the formation of two distinct phases and how can you force a phase separation when you encounter such situations,hemija,4066
4069,I'm currently taking VCE (Victorian Certificate of Education) Chemistry classes and we're currently studying the interpretation of spectra produced by Hydrogen NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy When studying the spectra of High Resolution 1 H NMR the peaks representing the different Hydrogen environments are split into multiplets based on the protons surrounding these environments There has been a considerable amount of confusion in my classes over the actual principles / rules of thumb on how to calculate the multiplets for a particular environment of a known chemical (i e ; known structue) based off the 'n + 1' rule (i e ; an environment with n neighbours will be split into n+1 multiplets) We are absolute on the principles that; Peaks of a particular Hydrogen environment are not split by neighbouring protons in equivalent environments OH does not and is not split by it's neighbouring environments However immense confusion arised over whether the following principle was correct Peaks of a particular Hydrogen environment will only be split by the protons in neighbouring environments once for each type of neighbouring environment e g The middle CH 2 environment in CH 3 –CH 2 –CH 3 will only have 4 peaks; Although it has 6 neighbouring protons they are two lots of the same environment (CH 3 ) As a class we found numerous examples from different text books and sources that provide examples of ¹H NMR spectra which did not clarify the matter; Some considered all neighbouring protons as neighbours others discriminated on the repeated neighbouring environments For example the CH 2 in CH 3 –CH 2 –CH 3 was sometimes split into 4 peaks or 7 peaks depending on the source Many Chemistry teachers contradicted each other on the matter There was repeated self corrections made by the teachers such that now nobody really knows whether this principle is correct or not So is there anybody that has the correct information on the matter Is there a reasonable explanation behind this strange lack of correlation or is there a common misconception about multiplet splitting Ultimately; How many multiplets should the CH 2 in CH 3 –CH 2 –CH 3 have (Note that if there is a complicated explanation that I am currently only at Year 12 VCE level so links to resources I can pursue would be extremely helpful It's been established that VCAA (an authority for the education system in Australia) ensures that the chemicals featured in the exams for NMR analysis will not be of a structure so as to allow the ambiguity above ),hemija,4078
4071,I am curious about the timescales of protonation and deprotonation of solvent systems As a followup how is this affected when the proton source is separated by an organic phase For instance it is known that the pH inside a liposome can be maintained from the outside What are the timescales of protonation when the protons need to be transported across various micelles thickness,hemija,21319
4072,Our work is faced with the issue of determining the charge of compounds that are dissolved in chloroform One could realistically determine the charge of the relevant moieties knowing the pKa of those groups However how would you determine or calculate the pH of an organic solvent An alternative way of asking this question is how would one calculate the concentration of hydronium ions or free protons in a nonaqueous solution,hemija,4318
4076,The Hofmeister Series is a useful metric in understanding how to precipate proteins However wikipedia and many other source indicate that the order of the series is rather empirical I'm curious about the variety of explanations of the mechanism of the series as well as the application of the series to other non-protein macromolecules,hemija,4077
4079,All arenes when treated with hot conc acidic $\rm KMnO_4$ are oxidised to benzoic/pthallic/etc acids I've tried to examine how this happens using the mechanism of oxidation of double bonds via cyclic intermediate as a reference but I can't manage to cook up a satisfactory one In an older book I have read that there is no (known) mechanism for many organic oxidation reactions I'm inclined to think that this may have changed So is there a mechanism for this If so what is it If not what are the hurdles in finding this mechanism (eg why don't other proposed mechanisms if they exist work ),hemija,4086
4087,I have a solution of copper acetate and I would like to play around with the ligands to get different colors Background The copper acetate was made through mixing vinegar (5% acetic acid) NaCl and C$_{\textrm{(s)}}$ The deep blue-colored copper acetate spontaneously formed during a month in my dark storage room [edit] I neglected to mention that the experiment simultaneously produced a 0 5 inch deposit of what appears to be Copper Carbonate or Verdigris on the bottom of the 1 Liter beaker Also I have let the copper acetate solution evaporate for several years now The former 1L is now 1/2 liter and has begun precipitating crystals (like the ones on the wiki page) Fun fact During the Renaissance glacial acetic acid was made by dry distilling metal acetates and primarily copper(II) acetate [/edit] Question(s) What easily obtained household chemicals may be mixed with samples of the copper acetate to change the ligands attached to the copper and thereby alter the color Will heating or cooling the solution change the color and/or ligands,hemija,4101
4088,One frequent argument against the safety of the synthetic sweetener aspartame is that it can be hydrolyzed with one of the hydrolysis products being methanol which is known to be toxic Of course usually not much aspartame is added in food anyway to yield a sufficient amount of methanol or its oxidation product formaldehyde but this does beg the question why wasn't say the ethyl ester chosen to be developed as an artificial sweetener Is there a structure-activity relationship between the alcohol used to esterify the dipeptide and the sweetness of the product,hemija,4173
4089,The nucleobases in DNA and RNA are generally present in the keto-form and not in the enol-form As an interesting historical note James Watson and Francis Crick did initially believe them to adopt the enol-form which isn't compatible with the correct model of the DNA they later proposed But there are some reports indicating that in certain RNA structures guanosine and uridine form essentially a Watson-Crick basepair where one of the two bases is present in the enol-form instead of the usual G-U wobble base pair Is there anything known on how large the energy difference between the keto- and the enol-form of those bases actually is,hemija,4095
4091,I am working on metal and its ion The problem is I would like to know whether the metal has been converted to its ionic form or not The hypothesis for the analysis is Metals are good conductors and ions possess redox potential Therefore by measuring the conductance and red-ox potential is it possible to differentiate whether I have metal or metal ion The question is Based on the hypothesis can I expect a positive result Apart from this is there any other technique where I can qualitatively / quantitatively measure metal and its ion,hemija,4097
4092,Whilst we are taught to represent benzene as below (A) due to its delocalised electrons however when two benzene rings share carbons (e g naphtalene) it seems to be more commonly represented in textbooks as two conjugated rings (B) Whilst I realise that the result is the same what is the advantage gained by drawing them like this rather than (C) Is it simply a matter of clarity A B C Whilst draing those in Marvin I wondered if it was as the delocalisation between the shared carbons isn't shown I e it looks like the electrons are delocalised across both rings separately rather than as one big ring,hemija,4098
4105,It is known that although only the (S) -enantiomer of the infamous sedative thalidomide possesses teratogenic properties it is not very useful to administer the pure (R) -enantiomer since it is racemized within the body Are there other known examples of drugs that are stereoconverted in vivo How does the body perform the conversion,hemija,4106
4141,I'm looking at the melting temperature of metallic elements and notice that the metals with high melting temperature are all grouped in some lower-left corner of the $d$ block If I take for example the periodic table with physical state indicated at 2 165 K I see that (apart from boron and carbon) the only elements still solid at that temperature form a rather well-defined block aroung tungsten (which melts at 3 695 K) So what makes this group of metals melt at such high temperature,hemija,4338
4142,Many diagrams of orbitals I've seen involve electrons moving through a center point—where the nucleus is How can this be Clearly they don't actually pass through the nucleus so what does happen,hemija,4186
4148,Both Vanadium and its 3+ ion are paramagnetic Use electron configuration to explain why this is so The electron configuration of Vanadium is [Ar] 4s 2  3d 3 If drawn in a box diagram it would be shown that the electron in the $d$ orbitals aren't paired This explains how an uncharged Vanadium is paramagnetic but if Vandium loses 3 electrons the only shells left are ones with paired electrons How can a Vanadium 3+ ion be paramagnetic if it loses all its unpaired electrons,hemija,4150
4151,When I look around for why copper and chromium only have one electron in their outermost s orbital and 5/10 in their outermost d orbital I'm bombarded with the fact that they are more stable with a half or completely filled d orbital so the final electron enters that orbital instead of the 'usual' s orbital What I'm really looking for is why the d orbital is more stable this way I assume it has to do with distributing the negative charge of the electrons as evenly as possible around the nucleus since each subshell of the d orbital is in a slightly different location leading to a more positive charge in the last empty or half-filled d orbital Putting the final electron in the s orbital would create a more negative charge around the atom as a whole but still leave that positive spot empty Why does this not happen with the other columns as well Does this extra stability work with all half or completely filled orbitals except columns 6 and 11 are the only cases where the difference is strong enough to 'pull' an electron from the s orbital It seems like flourine would have a tendency to do do this as well so I suppose the positive gap left in the unfilled p orbital isn't strong enough to remove an electron from the lower 2s orbital,hemija,4160
4152,My chemistry book explains that even though electrons in the 2p orbital are closer to the nucleus on average electrons from the 2s orbital spend a very short time very close to the nucleus (penetration) so it has a lower energy Why does this tiny amount of time spent close to the nucleus make such a big difference It seems like it should be the average distance that matters not the smallest distance achieved at any one point in determining stability What makes that momentary drop in energy so important that it is outweighs all the time spent farther away from the nucleus with a higher energy,hemija,4376
4153,There are some stereochemical reactions that result in the presence of enantiomers When moving forward with a practical organic synthesis how does one usually separate them in order to continue with one of the enantiomers,hemija,4155
4158,The most stable cyclohexane form is the chair conformation but on the other hand the bigger the side-chain of the cyclohexane is its hydrogen atoms become more equatorial rather than axial which brings them closer to the cyclohexane's hydrogens Shouldn't they arrange in a less energetic but a more stable conformation,hemija,4322
4162,Phosphate buffer is a common buffer in biological applications it's especially popular for NMR Magnesium ions are necessary for many biological systems to work though the amount of magnesium ions you can add in a phosphate buffer is limited by the relatively low solubility of magnesium phosphate What I'm curious about is whether the phosphate buffer can affect the availability of magnesium ions even in concentrations where no visible precipitation occurs Common phosphate buffer concentrations are around 10-100 mM and magnesium ions are usually 5 mM or below At those concentrations I see no visible precipitation but is the magnesium actually fully available or is the phosphate sequestering it and thereby lowering the effective magnesium ion concentration in the solution Even just calculating the solubility of magnesium salts in phosphate buffer is not straightforward as there are multiple species of magnesium phosphate and possibly even other salts like $\ce{MgKPO4}$ Does phosphate buffer affect the availability of magnesium ions in solution compared to a non-interacting buffer If that is so is there a way to calculate the size of that effect,hemija,8681
4163,I was tasked with figuring out whether Carbon or Nitrogen has a more negative electron affinity value I initially picked Nitrogen just because Nitrogen has a higher Z$_{eff}$ creating a larger attraction between electrons and protons decreasing the radius causing a higher Ionization Energy and therefore decreasing the electron affinity value but I was actually wrong and the solutions manual explains it as this As you trace from C to N across the periodic table you would normally expect N to have the more negative electron affinity However N has a half-filled p sublevel which lends it extra stability therefore it is harder to add an electron Are there any major exception rules when comparing electron affinity I'm hesitant to use Nitrogen as an exception because I don't know how far it extends If Nitrogen has a more positive EA than Carbon does that also extend to Boron or Aluminium or Phosphorus I later found that this also applies when comparing Silicone and Phosphorus The explanation was the same What exception rules should be noted when comparing electron affinity Are there any at all And how far does the exception with atoms with half-filled p sublevels extend Note I'm not entirely sure which tags fit this question so I encourage anyone who knows to edit it in,hemija,4166
4164,Most periodic tables only feature one Hydrogen atom on the top of the first group But some like the one I was given also show Hydrogen in the 7th group to left of Helium Why are there two Hydrogen atoms What's the difference between the two and why do we work with the left one more often than the right,hemija,4165
4168,Overall ring strain seems to be a big issue when it comes to organic chemistry That is why cyclopentane may be in an envelope form or why cyclobutane may be in a kinked kite form Both of these example molecules are not planar So why is epoxide (oxacyclopropane) a stable molecule if at all,hemija,4171
4172,According to wikipedia and the references given therein $\pi\cdots\pi$ stacking interactions are the result of interaction between the quadrupole moments of two aromatic rings rationalising the stabilisation of perpendicular and offset-parallel association modes of the benzene dimer Conventional wisdom is that the supramolecular complexes of buckminsterfullerene and functionalised corannulenes (the so-called buckycatchers) are stabilised by $\pi\cdots\pi$ stacking How can the quadrupole interaction explanation be reconciled with the pseudo-spherical symmetry of buckminsterfullerene Surely the interaction must be entirely Van der Waals in nature,hemija,4183
4174,Since the steam pressure of ammonia is higher than that of water I would expect distillation to be a reasonable way of seperating a mixture of both However in industrial applications known to me there's always a step of stripping the ammonia chemically from the vapor Why is this necessary,hemija,4451
4180,For example why does for example oxygen turn into gas at a much lower temperature than water Does it have anything to do with the molecular structure A water molecule does have a more complex structure than oxygen though the R-410A (a mixture of two gases commonly used in heating pumps) is much more complex than water and it boils at -48 5 degrees Celsius,hemija,4181
4187,If dry ammonia gas is passed through anhydrous copper sulfate will it turn blue (due to the formation of tetraamminecopper(II) complex) Or will silver chloride form diamminesilver(I) complex in liquid ammonia If the above complexes do not get formed in non-aqueous mediums why is it so,hemija,4188
4189,Over the course of my studies I have switched largely from using Z-matrix representations of molecular geometries in calculations to Cartesian representations The software that I use now makes it easy to add the sorts of constraints/restraints/transits that I would have previously used Z-matrices for and I know that Z-matrix geometries can be problematic in large molecules * where minute changes in a bond angle or dihedral (due for instance to rounding errors/low-quality gradients) can result in large movements in peripheral atoms What pros or cons exist for either geometry definition that I don't know about What circumstances recommend one representation over another *Or small molecules with silly Z-matrices,hemija,4192
4191,Pennsylvania State University provides irradiated $\ce{NaCl}$ (180 000 rads of gamma radiation) to teachers for a very entertaining demonstration The salt is orange after irradiation When it is placed on a hot plate you see a flash of visible light and the salt returns to it normal color The explanation provided with the salt is that The heat allows the electrons that were trapped in the crystal structure (when the energy was deposited) to return to their original position This language evokes a picture of a particle electron in a crystal jail for me The explanation goes on to say that the energy is released as a photon of visible light (I understand this part of the explanation ) So my question is how are electrons trapped in a crystal structure What keeps them in an excited state,hemija,4193
4194,To my understanding cationic polymerization is a type of living polymerization but my teacher's notes and Wikipedia seem to suggest they're different I can't see the difference The same goes for anionic polymerization From what I've studied so far the difference must be subtle if there is one Is there such a difference,hemija,4524
4215,I've always seen benzyne (benzene with a triple bond) classified as an intermediate I really don't see why it needs to be an intermediate though The possible reasons I can come up with are flimsy It has an unstable sp 2 – sp 2 $\pi$ bent bond we have bent bonds with more angle strain in cyclopropane which is not an intermediate Though those bonds are $\sigma$ bonds It immediately reacts with itself to form a dimer biphenylene in the absence of other reagents there are many other molecules which spontaneously dimerize (eg $\ce{NO2}$ at certain temperatures) yet they are not classified as intermediates So what makes benzyne an intermediate More generally (but possibly too broad) what makes a molecule an intermediate,hemija,4218
4216,You can buy NMR tubes in a huge variety of qualities with an equally huge difference in price between the cheapest and the most expensive NMR tubes They are usually rated for a specific spectrometer frequency e g 300 MHz+ or 600 MHz+ What is the difference between these different grades of NMR tubes And how large is the effect on the quality of the spectra if a lower-grade tube is used,hemija,4219
4217,There are two kinds of bonds between polymers in solid material primary and secondary Primary bonds can be also called cross-linked bonds What is the difference between the two (strength type response to stress/strain etc) How do they compare to bonds inside a polymer,hemija,4227
4220,Given an organic compound is there any way to decide if it is volatile (or compare volatility--everything is volatile in the end) Volatility is due to the tendency to evaporate The conclusion I can draw from this is that a more volatile compound will be lighter and/or will have less intermolecular forces But this doesn't seem to work--I recall that methanol is less volatile than ethanol ([citation needed]) So are there any general guidelines for this or is it another experimental property,hemija,4223
4222,The main chemistry prep room at my institution (and also at the ambulance station) is labelled with the standard green compressed gas sign However there is a small '2' included within the diamond None of the chemistry technicians tutors or ambulance staff seem to know what it is referring to and I can't find any reference of it on the internet Would anyone here happen to know The related products of this online provider show that other hazards have different numbers but some also have two (e g flammable) Is there a standard that is being referred to here,hemija,4224
4228,Diborane has the interesting property of having two 3-centered bonds that are each held together by only 2 electrons (see the diagram below from Wikipedia ) These are known as banana bonds I'm assuming there is some sort of bond hybridization transpiring but the geometry doesn't seem like it is similar to anything I'm familiar with Carbon doing What sort of hybridization is it and why don't we see many (any ) other molecules with this bond structure,hemija,4229
4230,If you characterize the chemical bonds to two categories physical and chemical bonds how do you do it Aren't all bonds chemical and physical From the freedictionary com chemical bond Any of several forces especially the ionic bond covalent bond and metallic bond by which atoms or ions are bound in a molecule or crystal What is the physical bond then How should the atom be bonded to molecule if these bonds are not the ones What are these several forces excactly In the answer I would like to see the lists of chemical and physical bonds,hemija,4234
4235,Neil Bartlett (1932–2008) first synthesized $\ce{XeF{_4}}$ (and $\ce{XeF{_6}}$) in 1962 In the synthesis a nickel chamber is used and heated to 400&deg;C causing the formation of $\ce{NiF{_4}}$ which Wikipedia claims is not part of the reaction Due to the nature of the noble gas xenon one might imagine that the fluorines would need to could be forced onto the $\ce{Xe}$ atom at the same time otherwise with each addition the molecule would be even less energetically likely I was trying to ascertain in what geometric form the four fluorine atoms would configure themselves to make this addition possible I had first assumed that the nickel was being used as a catalyst and the fluorines could be plucked from its surface accordingly but this does not jive with the description of the synthesis above According to the response below one synthesis of the molecule does rely on forming fluoride radicals on a catalyst but it's mysterious that the synthesis above does not mention this Assuming there is no catalyst how are the fluorines at 400&deg;C oriented to allow the addition of 2 molecules at presumably the same time F - F F - F (and is that even possible ),hemija,4237
4236,I've known that hybridization in distorted geometries is not exactly $sp^3$ or $sp^2$ or whatever For example $\ce{PH3}$ has nearly pure $p$ orbitals in the $\ce{P-H}$ bond and the lone pair is in a nearly pure $s$ orbital Basically since hybridisation is an addition of wavefunctions instead of a perfect symmetrical addition of the kets we get something else While answering this question I realised that it's not that easy predicting the numbers Take the same image of $\ce{B2H6}$ At first seeing the 97&deg; I thought well the inner $\ce{B-H}$ bonds will be almost pure $p$ But with that I couldn't figure out where the 120&deg; came from because that is for perfect $sp^2$ I then realised that I was being stupid and it wasn't that simple--just because you have a 120&deg; doesn't mean pure $sp^2$ But I was at a loss trying to find out approximate hybridizations for $\ce{B2H6}$ How does one generally go about predicting such nonuniform hybridizations if one knows the bond angles Approximations are OK--I believe the exact mixture ratios will require some knowledge of the exact wavefunctions,hemija,4339
4238,I've always thought that orbitals lead to a loss of symmetry and have never been able to give myself a satisfactory answer to this I'll explain via an example Let's take an $\ce{N^3+}$ atom It's perfectly spherical and has no distinguishing 'up' and 'down' There is no set of 'preferred coordinate axes' for it since it has spherical symmetry (except the nucleus but I doubt that matters) Now let's give it three electrons They arrange themselves in the $2p$ orbitals one in each (by Hund's rule) Now suddenly the atom has lost its spherical symmetry — we have a distinct triplet of orthogonal directions separate from the others This leads to these questions How can symmetry 'break' this way Are the directions of the axes 'hidden' in the atom beforehand Are they themselves wavefunctions (though a wavefunction of wavefunctions sound odd to me this explanation makes sense-random events can break symmetries) So I'd like a clear explanation of how/why the symmetry breaks,hemija,4334
4240,Let's say I synthesized or isolated a chiral molecule and want to know the absolute configuration (R or S) of that molecule I could obviously solve the structury by X-Ray crystallography but that's a lot of work and I might not want to do that or might not have access to the necessary equipment What other ways exist to determine the absolute configuration of a molecule experimentally,hemija,4241
4242,I remember seeing a periodic table that had the top-left corner of the d-block shaded and marked as brittle If I recall correctly the elements were $\ce{Sc Ti V Cr Mn Y Zr Nb La}$ I think (Sorry I can't find much on it on the Net) The triangular shaded area is a clear indicator of a groupwise and period wise trend (similar to how the nonmetals form a triangle due to the electron affinity/Ionization potential trends) So I ask what are the trends leading to the brittleness of a metal and more importantly why are these trends there (usually trends can be explained in terms of simpler things like atomic size/sheilding/etc),hemija,8555

4249,Besides elucidating or verifying a chemical structure NMR can also be used e g for quantifying a mixture of different chemicals Depending on the quality of the spectrum and the specific substance integrating the NMR signals for the same molecule can result in significant variations from the actual ratio of nuclei which is known from the chemical structure What factors do affect the quantification of NMR signals in a proton 1D spectrum What precautions should one take during acquisition and processing of NMR spectra to make sure that the spectra can be analyzed quantitatively,hemija,4371
4250,I once had an Orgo TA refer to a diazo compound as diazo-boom-boom (the technical term) I have always been curious as to the reason behind the instability and reactivity According to wikipedia Some of the most stable diazo compounds are ?-diazoketones and ?-diazoesters since the negative charge is delocalized into the carbonyl In contrast most alkyldiazo compounds are explosive What is it about the alkyldiazos that makes them so much more unstable There doesn't appear to be any bond strain or other factors Naively I can say that having a resonance structure should make it marginally more stable,hemija,4251

4263,I have come across many reactions that are zero order reactions but at one glance I'm unable to tell if they are zero order or not Is there any criteria that can be used to identify these reactions or are they purely experimentally determined,hemija,4265
4264,One of the drugs I work with is a beta-lactam (4-membered ring with an amide bond) fused to a sulfone ring tazobactam It's relatively stable in water; the lactam is not significantly hydrolyzed without being catalyzed When the lactam is hydrolyzed however typically by an enzyme and the lactam ring opened the sulfone ring also opens cleaving the bond between the sulfur and bridgehead carbon A paper by Kuzin gives the following reaction scheme (this is part of figure 2 click for the whole thing) and says of it (emphasis mine) The Ser70-bound moiety (2) is thought to be the initial intermediate [ ] Ring opening after departure of the sulfinate from C5 produces a reactive imine (3) and the more inert tautomeric enamine forms (4 5) But why is the sulfuryl (sulfone sulfonyl( ) ) leaving only when the lactam is opened and not spontaneously beforehand Other fused bicyclic beta-lactam drugs don't open the other ring where in lieu of the sulfone there is commonly a thioether (as in penicillin) The sulfone group seems more electron hungry but I don't see how the broken lactam bond affects this I've heard some people suggest that the lone pair on the nitrogen is able to make this happen but why doesn't it then happen in the intact drug,hemija,4268
4267,Oscillating reactions are a funny aspect of chemistry I have tried to find various simplified kinetic models of oscillating reactions such as the Belouzov-Zhabotinsky the Briggs–Rauscher or the Bray–Liebhafsky reactions in order to be able to study them However the models I have found so far are either too complicated (8 or more species considered) or loose chemical significance For an example of the second case Ball's 1994 model [1] corresponds to While this is useful and introduces a nice circularity in the model creating the possible feedback it has lost all chemical sense — by which I mean that no correspondance can be established between the species of this model and a real oscillating system So my question is what's the simplest known chemically-meaningful model of an oscillating reaction [1] Ball P 1994 Designing the molecular world Chemistry at the frontier Princeton NJ Princeton University Press,hemija,4274
4270,Periodic acid (per-iodic acid $\ce{HIO4}$ ) cleaves vicinal diols(to carbonyls) via a cyclic intermediate Due to the cyclic intermediate it needs a syn configuration for the $\ce{-OH}$ groups for the reaction Exactly which configurations are allowed on cyclohexane derivatives Let's take 1 2-dihydroxycyclohexane(boat conformer) If the two hydroxy groups are both on the axial positions ( trans- ) then obviously the reaction will not take place What about when the two are cis- (one axial one equatorial) and when they are both equatorial ( trans- ) (My original question had to do with diastereomers of cyclic glucose--aldohexoses--but I realised that the extra hydroxy groups make the reaction more complicated),hemija,4516

4275,Historically thiols $\ce{-SH}$ were known as mercapto- due to their strong propensity to bond with mercury Certain drugs still carry this designation though mercaptopurine has an $\ce{=S}$ group instead of a thiol What makes the thiol group bond so strongly with mercury in particular Why don't alcohols make such a strong bond with $\cf{Hg}$ If it's known was there any historical reason why it was important to be able to capture mercury,hemija,4277
4276,In a thesis I am reading it is said that one of the reasons for using plane-wave basis sets for first-principles molecular dynamics (aka ab initio MD) is that the Pulay forces [1 2] that arise from an MD using atomic basis sets are computationally expensive to calculate While I understand that having additional terms means more code to write i e they make writing the software harder to write is it true that they are CPU-intensive to compute The criterion I would use to quantify this subjective statement is Given that you have already calculated the energy and forces at that point you have already computed a large number of integrals required for this task and involving basis functions overlap integrals terms of the form $\left\langle\phi_\alpha\left|\hat{A}\right|\phi_\beta\right\rangle$ where operator $\hat{A}$ is either the hamltonian its gradient or any other operator necessary for the calculation of energy or forces Would the calculation of Pulay forces require any more integrals to be evaluated or can it be straightforwardly computed from those previously-calculated integrals alone [1] P Pulay Molec Phys 19 197 (1969) [2] See also slide 6 of this,hemija,4337
4278,Related (very similar but here I want a mechanism) http //physics stackexchange com/q/21827/7433 By the Kohlrausch law all ions contribute to the conductivity of an electrolyte Now as I understand it the mechanism of conduction in an electrolyte is thus Ions migrate in solution These ions get reduced or oxidized at the electrodes and converted to electrons These electrons continue down the wire leading to an increased/maintained conductivity/current But this mechanism doesn't work for ions which do not get redoxed--movement of ions in the solution cannot be translated to movement of electrons in the wire and thus it seems (to me) that conductivity should not increase But ions like $\ce{NO3-}$ have a comparable $\lambda$ (ionic molar conductivity)--so they experimentally do increase conductivity What is the mechanism for conduction via these ions,hemija,4291
4279,I mixed $6 0~\rm mL$ of $ 01\ \rm M$ $\ce{Pb(NO3)2}$ and $6 0~\rm mL$ of $0 02\ \rm M$ $\ce{KI}$ and $8 0~\rm mL$ of water and a precipitate (barely) formed I calculated the $K_{sp}$ with $[\ce{Pb^{2+}}][{I^-}]^2$ to get $1 1\times 10^{-7}$ The problem is that the accepted value is $9 8\times 10^{-9}$ which is off by a factor of 10 I'm pretty sure I had clean equipment and measured carefully and accurately where did I go wrong here I calculated $[\ce{Pb^{2+}}]$ as $0 0036 ~\rm M$ and $[\ce{I-}]$ as $0 0060~\rm M$ I'm assuming my math is wrong here is it just more likely that I had some inaccuracies in my experiment Yes this was done for school but my question is not a question in my homework,hemija,4288
4285,My understanding is that the NBO methodology transforms the molecular orbital picture of a molecule into a collection of pairwise interactions (bond orbitals) This is obviously handy for didactic and comprehension purposes as it distils what might be a very complex and non-local MO picture into manageable lobes conforming to the introductory theories of chemical bonding (VB orbital hybridisation) taught in high-school and early university courses Does natural bond orbital theory have utility outside of this role,hemija,4292
4286,When I was reading through the ADF-BAND tutorials one of the toy systems presented was a 1-D periodic structure involving 3 collinear hydrogen atoms The tutorial pointed out that topologically speaking this is cylindrically symmetrical (more specifically it's ring symmetrical) In the instance of a 2-D structure can the calculation be considered a model for the surface of a torus (this seems logical) a sphere (I doubt this because if you fit a rectilinear grid to a sphere you end up with two poles and dissimilar meridians and parallels) or other Bonus questions Has anyone used periodic calculations to model electronic structure/chemistry on the surface of a sphere or torus Can you introduce a curvature term to account for these structures having a finite size,hemija,4287
4289,Can derive the quantity of a substance from a GC/MS report if I know the ratio to another substance in the data the quantity of that second substance and the molecular mass of both substances The site was very dense and vague regarding how GC/MS test work but fairly upfront regarding how they derive their ratios Here are the numbers (slightly tweaked but more or less in proportion) Substance A Quantity $300&#160;\ \mathrm{mg}$ (Know already not part of GC/MS report) Mol Mass $500&#160;\ \mathrm{g/mol}$ (found in external source) Peak Proportion 3 Substance X Quantity Unknown Mol Mass $425&#160;\ \mathrm{g/mol}$ (again external source) Peak Proportion 1 To be clear the ratio of 1 3 means that substance X has a horizontal peak $\frac13$ of substance A I'm not clear on what the x-axis is actually a measurement of which is part of why I'm at a loss The site does make it very explicit that the ratios are not directly proportional to mass ratio (so if it found a ratio of 3 1 of glucose to arsenic this doesn't mean the substance is 75% glucose and 25% arsenic only that the glucose peaks 3 times higher which I've taken to mean 3 times the oomph but that may be incorrect as well) So if I know that the molecular mass($M$) of substance X is 0 85 of substance Y can I derive the actual mass of substance X using the formula \begin{equation}\mathrm{qty}_X=\frac{\mathrm{qty}_A\times(M_X/M_A)}{\mathrm{peak}_A/\mathrm{peak}_X}\end{equation} with data being \begin{equation}qty_X=\frac{300\ \mathrm{mg}\times(425/500)}{3/1}\end{equation} Which simplifies to \begin{equation}qty_X=(300\text{ mg}\times 0 85)/3\end{equation} and finally the result of $85&#160;\ \mathrm{mg}$ So I guess in the end there are 3 questions Is this even how GC/MS results work If so is my assumption to derive the mystery quantity using the molecular mass correct Is the math itself in order (I'm specifically worried that I should invert either the mass ratio or the peak ratio or both) Of course if the answer to the first questions is no then my true question is can I derive the quantity of substance X with the given data and if so what would be the right approach If anyone is curious for some context I need to know the actual quantity of substance X as I know that by mass it has a threshold between harmless and toxic so just knowing substance X is $\frac13$ peak of substance A doesn't let me know if I should let my dog/child/self ingest it,hemija,4323
4290,Is there a formal definition or algorithm that can take a list of reactions and tell me whether it contains a set of species that can produce itself autocatalytically It is clear that the following reaction is autocatalytic $$\ce{ A + B \to 2 B }$$ B appears on both sides of the equation so it's a catalysis reaction and there is an extra B produced on the right so it catalyses its own production from A But the following reaction scheme can also be considered to contain autocatalysis $$ \ce{B + C \to D + E\\ A + D \to 2C} $$ If this system starts out with plenty of A and B together with one molecule of C then the C molecule can react with a B to produce a D which can then react with an A to produce two C's — whereas without the initial seed molecule no reactions will take place (I'm neglecting reverse reactions here of course but hopefully it gets the point across ) The autocataltic cycle can easily be seen in the following diagram where circles represent species and boxes represent reactions Another non-obvious example of autocatalysis is a reaction scheme of this form $$\ce{ A + C \to C + D\\ B + D \to D + C + E} $$ Here C and D each catalyse the production of one another from the precursors A and B I'm aware of Kauffman's definition of reflexively autocatalytic sets which applies to schemes of this form but would miss an autocatalytic cycle of the kind shown above since it doesn't consist of single-step catalysis reactions So I'm looking for a definition of autocatalysis that would include both cases as well as (hopefully) other more complex schemes that I haven't yet thought of,hemija,4805
4293,Looking at something like $\cf{ YBa{_2}Cu{_3}O{_7}}$ which was one of the first cuprate superconductors to be discovered I'm always curious how the selection of these substances as likely superconductors comes about Does it have to do with optimal crystalline structure unpaired electrons or is it similar to the way semiconductors are designed with doping to create holes Or are these superconductors simply determined experimentally based on small changes of what has worked in the past As a side question I've always been curious as to how they stumbled upon Yttrium for this particular case It's not something I think of as being carried in ready supply Would this have been after YAG lasers were already around,hemija,4352

4298,I've always been a bit uncomfortable with the concept of more than two electrons in a single orbital-like region(probability-wise) which occurs in resonance This seems to disobey Pauli's exclusion principle Let's take benzene for example It has a delocalized cloud of electrons These all had the original (as in if resonance didn't occur) quantum numbers $n=2 l=1 m=\text{(1 0 or -1; but it must be the same for all)} m_s=\pm\frac12$ But due to delocalization they're now all in one extra-large orbital-like region (by orbital-like I mean that the pi cloud is similar to an orbital in the sense that it is also a probability cloud which defines the probabilities of finding one or more electrons at different coordinates) Now it's obvious that the original quantum numbers are insufficient here due to Pauli's exclusion principle They may not even exist for these electrons The easiest thing to do would be to propose (not exactly propose since I guess the Dirac equation can prove their existence) an extra quantum number which can take twelve values Or a combination of a few extra quantum numbers that have the same effect But this raises the question do the electrons belonging to the pi cloud retain their original quantum numbers as well Basically I want to know how benzene and other resonating compounds are described quantum mechanically with focus on quantum numbers (links to papers are fine probably necessary here--but please explain the gist of the link) I'd prefer the answer in terms of simpler quantum mechanics though I'm not averse to the idea of some extra reading,hemija,4302
4299,In many places I've seen the extra bond in benzyne being labelled as $sp^2-sp^2$ overlap or distorted (not parallel) $p\pi-p\pi$ overlap But I've failed to see why we can't have a normal parallel $p\pi-p\pi$ overlap Wikipedia says In benzyne however the p orbitals are distorted to accommodate the triple bond within the ring system reducing their effective overlap That makes no sense to me — why can't a normal parallel $p\pi-p\pi$ overlap be accomodated within the system So what is the reason for the distorted $\pi$ bond in benzyne I'm fine with answers involving a bit of QM/MO theory,hemija,4301
4300,From here I can see why hapticity changes here but not why it is necessary for the benzene ring to bend The resonance energy of benzene is pretty large and there's no balancing increase in stability elsewhere--unless the decrease of hapticity increases stability which I doubt (more delocalization=more stability not vice versa) Also the concept of a bent benzene is a bit strange to me I'd like to know what exactly is going on in this reaction and why it happens @F'x mentioned that the bent benzene may just be a way of drawing the molecule to clearly show the change of overlap If this is the case I'd still like to know how the hapticity changed (because my initial logic behind change of hapticity is invalid if the structure doesn't actually bend),hemija,4311
4306,In “periodic table” the adjective is related to the noun period and comes from Ancient Greek ???????? through French périodique In “periodic acid” it is formed from the prefix per- and iodic (like peroxide and permanganate ) Wiktionary lists their respective UK pronunciations of as /p??(?) i??d?k/ and /?p??ra???d?k/ markedly different p??

4314,I have been reading about resolution in Mass Spectrometry and there are a few things I do not understand The resolving power is determined by m/(m2-m1) at full width half height of a peak The higher the value obtained the better This is where I struggle to form a link between the resolution of the Mass spectrometer and the resolving power In image A below the resolution of the Mass Spectrometer is 1000 and would have a very low mass resolution value but in image B the resolution is 5000 and the nominal peaks masses are separated therefore providing a high mass resolution value Why can a mass spectrometer with a resolution of 5000 resolve the nominal masses and the mass spectrometer with a resolution of 1000 cannot and how does the mass resolution come into play Also what do the values of 1000 and 5000 mean,hemija,4315
4316,In Density Functional Theory courses one is often reminded that Kohn-Sham orbitals are often said to bear no any physical meaning They only represent a noninteracting reference system which has the same electron density as the real interacting system That being said there are plenty of studies in that field’s literature that given KS orbitals a physical interpretation often after a disclaimer similar to what I said above To give only two examples KS orbitals of H 2 O [1] and CO 2 closely resemble the well-known molecular orbitals Thus I wonder what good (by virtue of being intuitive striking or famous) examples can one give as a warning of intepreting the KS orbitals resulting from a DFT calculation [1] “What Do the Kohn-Sham Orbitals and Eigenvalues Mean ” R Stowasser and R Hoffmann J Am Chem Soc 1999 121 3414–3420,hemija,4336

4324,Many computational chemistry packages permit the calculation of vibrational and electronic spectra These spectra are obtained as a set of discrete eigenvalues however they are often convolved with some distribution to give a continuous spectrum that is realistic for a finite temperature rather than a sequence of impulse functions The ADF package allows the user to convolve the spectrum with either a Gaussian or Cauchy (Lorentzian) function My understanding is that the latter affords a more realistic line broadening however the Gaussian must be there for a reason Which spectral broadening scheme is preferred Why the choice,hemija,4325
4326,The identification of point groups of a molecule is usually done following a strict scheme either manually or algorithmically In all textbooks I could find however the first step of the scheme is actually not explicited in this example scheme drawn from Housecroft and Sharpe you can see that there is a very unhelpful step “Does this molecule have $I_h$ $O_h$ or $T_d$ symmetry ” It is implied that one would recognize e g an icosahedral molecular compound on sight However I wonder how can one strictly identify these “special” point groups What set of rules is to be followed (again either manually or algorithmically),hemija,4327

4340,We have a well that delivers hard water and we do not have a water softener (There was a “green sand filter” that utilizes permanganate to oxidize other metals on the system but it has been disconnected ) Analysis of the well water shows the presence of iron in noticeable amounts No other metal ions were specifically identified The system does have an ozonator to oxidize Fe (II) to Fe (III) Over the last couple of years the porcelain toilet bowls have developed a blue ring at the air/water interface When you scrub on the blue ring it doesn’t feel like there is a deposit present (like normal hard water deposits) The ring is unresponsive to ammonia (household) strong acid (6 M HCL) or strong base (Drano) as well as to hydrogen peroxide (30 %) (We haven’t tried a good reducing agent yet ) So my question is does anyone have an idea of what is causing the blue color Is it possible that porcelain reacted chemically with salts urea uric acid oxygen etc Not an earth-shattering theoretical question but I’m chemically curious as to what this could be if anyone has any ideas,hemija,5024

4342,The ideal gas equation (daresay law ) is a fascinating combination of the work of dozens of scientists over a long period of time I encountered Van der Waal's interpretation for non-ideal gases early on and it was always somewhat in a closed-form $${\bigl(p + \frac{n^2a}{V^2}\bigr)(V - nb) = nRT}$$ with $a$ being a measure of the charge interactions between the particles and $b$ being a measure of the volume interactions Understandably this equation is only still around for historical purposes as it is largely inaccurate Fast-forwarding to the 1990s Wikipedia has a listing of one of the more current manifestations (of Elliott Suresh and Donohue) $$\frac{p V_m}{RT}=Z=1 + Z^{\rm{rep}} + Z^{\rm{att}}$$ where the repulsive and attractive forces between the molecules are proportional to a shape number ($c = 1$ for spherical molecules a quadratic for others) and reduced number density which is a function of Boltzmann's constant etc (point being a lot of fudge factors and approximations are getting thrown into the mix) Rather than seeking an explanation of all of this I am wondering whether a more closed form solution lies at the end of the tunnel or whether the approximations brought forth in the more modern models will have to suffice,hemija,4350

4369,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) is a particularly useful technique for examining the surfaces of all sorts of materials Organic monolayers are particularly difficult to characterize completely via this technique due to the fact that many carbon peaks do not differ much by chemical shift Traditionally quantitative information is obtained via a lot of guess-work and forced peak fitting It would be better to predict peaks shapes and peak positions beforehand to aid in the interpretation and prevent a terribly mis-guided interpretation How well can theory help the non-specialist with this I wouldn't have the time to develop a program to do this either Preferably one could point me to the right direction in terms of a research paper/software,hemija,8371
4372,I have the following question to solve Tungsten (W) and chlorine (Cl) form a series of compounds with the following compositions Mass % W Mass % Cl 72 17 27 83 56 45 43 55 50 91 49 09 46 36 53 64 If a molecule of each compound contains only one tungsten atom what are the formulas for the four compounds My answer is as follows For one gram of tungsten chlorine has mass $\frac{27 83}{72 17}=0 3302$ g $\frac{43 55}{56 45}=0 7715$ g $\frac{49 09}{50 91}=0 9643$ g $\frac{53 64}{46 36}=1 157$ g Since $\frac{0 7715}{0 3302}\approx\frac{7}{3}$ $\frac{0 9643}{0 3302}\approx3$ and $\frac{1 157}{0 3302}\approx\frac{7}{2}$ the number of atoms of chlorine for a given mass of tungsten are respectively in the ratio $6 14 18 21$ So if a molecule of each compound contains only one tungsten atom the formulas are $\ce{WCl_{6}}$ $\ce{WCl_{14}}$ $\ce{WCl_{18}}$ and $\ce{WCl_{21}}$ Is this correct,hemija,4373
4374,In the standard brown ring test for the nitrate ion the brown ring is $$\ce{[Fe(H2O)5 (NO)]^{2+}}$$ In this compound the nitrosyl ligand is positively charged and iron is in a $+1$ oxidation state Now Iron has stable oxidation states $+2 +3$ Nitrosyl as a ligand comes in many flavours of which a negatively charged nitrosyl is one I see no reason why the iron doesn't spontaneously oxidise to +3 and reduce the NO to -1 to gain stability But I don't know how to analyse this situation anyway I think that there may be some nifty backbonding increasing the stability but I'm not sure So why is iron in +1 here when we can have a seemingly stable situation with iron in +3,hemija,16389
4378,In a series of papers in the early 1980s Michael Springborg explored an interpretation of the Wigner phase space function as an electron density in a six-dimensional $(q p)$ phase space He applied it with some success to several simple compounds Is the Springborg 6D phase model model used in modern molecular orbital modeling If not are there specific weaknesses that make it unsuitable for current computational approaches ADDENDUM 2012-05-14 In a world dominated by Hilbert spaces the orbitals of chemistry are interesting because they are one of the few places in physics where a 3D spatial image of the underlying quantum situation is consistently retained (My recollection is that Schrodinger liked such low-dimensionality approaches since they emphasized waves that could be visualized ) Alas the problem of course is that you need both position $q$ and momentum $p$ to get an accurate picture of the overall electron state Using a space-only 3D $q$ representation forces the analysis of molecules to flip back and forth at rather arbitrary thresholds between localized (position space $q$) and delocalized (momentum space $p$) views of the electrons in the molecules or metal crystals in question That bothers me both from a physics perspective and from a computational integrity perspective The problem is that there exists a very deep and profound physics symmetry between $q$ and $p$ in terms of how effects such as Pauli exclusion applies to fermions I find that simple symmetry nothing short of amazing because to me there's just nothing intuitive about the idea that half-unit spin would result in such extraordinarily similar behaviors in these quite different spaces At some level it seems to be one of those cases of that's just the way it works So it seems pretty reasonable that accurate modeling of orbitals of many diverse sizes likely requires this symmetry to be captured accurately If that's true this older work by Springborg (he still heads a research group BTW) strikes me as a possible opportunity to for taming some models making them smoother and more sane over a much broader range of molecular sizes That's because Springborg's 6D electron density functions -- if they work OK in broader contexts -- might help eliminate any need for abrupt switches between mostly position or $q$ 3D views (classic electron clouds whatever those really mean) and mostly momentum or $p$ 3D views A good place to test whether 6D $(q p)$ electron distributions might provide higher computational stability would be in modeling a range of lengths for a long-chain carbon polymer such as polyacetylene (I always pick polyacetylene for its simplicity but there are other good choices ) Springborg appears not to have explored that domain since as best I can tell his papers addressed mostly simpler bonds (I think; I don't have them ) The instabilities of approximate density functional theories may (or may not) be related to $(q p)$ transition instabilities That's not a question I can or should try to address as there are folks out there who know that domain orders of magnitude better than I ever will ADDENDUM 2012-05-16 I mentioned algorithmic opportunity and wondered what I meant myself by that since as @AcidFlask reminds the $q$ and $p$ basis sets are fully interchangeable in terms of representing any stationary wavefunction The issue is (again I think) one of accumulating uncertainty Picture doing some kind of calculation in the $q$ representation For a highly lo,hemija,4391
4379,I'm reading a book on carbon nanotubes (P J F Harris Carbon Nanotube Science to be specific) at the moment and puzzling about Stone-Wales or 5775 defects This is where two adjacent carbons undergo a 90-degree rotation about their mutual centroid and generate a defect consisting of two five membered rings and two seven membered rings as I've illustrated below (This is only supposed to be qualitative and is on a finite PAH fragment rather than a nanotube but you should get the idea) I note that tropylium ($\ce{[C7H7]^+}$) is aromatic as a cation and the ever famous cyclopentadienide ($\ce{[C5H5]^-}$) is aromatic as an anion so what I'm wondering is do the 5 and 7-membered rings in a Stone-Wales defect pick up either formal or partial negative and positive charges to maintain aromaticity in a fashion consistent with the rest of the structure P S Big props to F'x who attempted electronic structure calculations on the PAHs depicted regrettably without SCF convergence,hemija,4381
4380,My Sister asked me this Why is it that when we chew gum it is soft and mushy to begin with but slowly gets firmer and firmer like after 20 mins of chewing I think it is because when we initially chew gum it has plenty of sugar causing rapid salivation and hence mushiness and the rubber polymer is very flexible to begin with and slowly looses its elasticity hence becomes firmer Is this the reason What is the chemistry involved,hemija,4382

4389,In this molecule which is 3 5-dimethyl-4-carboxypyrazolate (unless I got it wrong) I do not think there is free rotation around the bond indicated in red because one can write a resonance structure with significant reasonable weight where a double bond would be located between the two groups However how can I go further than that and qualitatively describe the energy barrier for the rotation I have found ( here and there ) that in the case of benzoates the barrier is in the range 3–6 kcal/mol Should I expect it to be higher or lower in the above molecule,hemija,4628

4397,In many tests for various radicals a &lt;color&gt; precipitate or &lt;color&gt; turbidity is mentioned For example lead acetate with chromate ions gives a yellow precipitate but hydrogen sulphide with potassium dichromate gives a yellow(or white) turbidity In the reaction itself the turbidity is noted as a precipitate with a down arrow but I'm wondering if there is any difference between the two It looks like turbidity refers to a colloid/suspension being formed but I'm not sure I'd like to know The physical differences/distinguishing features between turbidity and precipitate if any The observable differences/distinguishing features between the two if any,hemija,4398

4401,The Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA) is a valuable metric for looking at protein folding and protein-protein interactions However this measurement is typically done by calculating the SASA from a solved (and generally static) structure Chemical probes like diazirine and hydroxyl radicals show some bias regarding where they tend to bind I'm realizing while I'm writing this question that NMR is a perfectly valid method to determine a solution based structure and then calculate the SASA Similar strategies has also been used to examine structured RNAs I'm curious about the variety of these methods and how accurate they are,hemija,4403

4410,Related Reaction between Silver Nitrate and Aluminium Chloride Experimentally $\ce{AgCl}$ is insoluble in water but $\ce{AgNO3}$ is soluble They're pretty common in a lab (well $\ce{AgCl}$ is a common precipitate)--so I think most of us know this By Fajan's rules on the other hand larger anion $\implies$ more polarization/covalent character $\implies$ less solubility But $\ce{NO3-}$ is the larger anion yet $\ce{AgNO3}$ is more soluble Is there any theoretical reason for this,hemija,4427
4411,Hematite is composed of $\ce{Fe2O3}$ and is paramagnetic whereas magnetite is $\ce{Fe3O4}$ and is diamagnetic Magnetite's nature is due to the presence of both $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ and $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$ (Wikipedia even goes so far as to call it $\ce{FeO}\cdot \ce{Fe2O3}$ but explains that this is not a solid solution ) I can surmise that in the crystalline solid there are divalent and trivalent cations dispersed within I can also assume that there might be some sharing of electrons between the oxygens and each of these cations One would assume this also happens within the hematite crystal so what is it about tossing the divalent cation into the mix of the crystalline structure that makes the magnetite diamagnetic Does the charge differential between the two cations cause a permanent dipole if so why don't all of the small dipoles simply cancel each other out,hemija,4413

4429,Lithium and magnesium are Group 1 and Group 2 elements respectively Elements of these groups are highly ionic and I've never heard of them forming significantly covalent inorganic compounds Yet these elements form a variety of organometallic compounds ($\ce{PhLi}$ the whole family of Grignard reagents etc) Organometallic compounds have significant covalent character (i e the bond can be called covalent) in the carbon–metal bond What's so special about carbon that makes these elements form covalent bonds,hemija,4433
4430,I've been asked this question a few times and while I think I know the answer I'd like to know more Graphite as we know is a sheet polymer Since polymers are bound to be finite by physical considerations graphite must have edges My question is what happens at these edges I can cook up these possibilities A graphene sheet folds back on itself thus forming a tube and taking care of most of the edge carbons But this would make graphite less slippery so I doubt this is the case Random elements/compounds from the environment at time of synthesis latch on to the edges taking care of the valency of Carbon The edge carbons form double/triple bonds amongst themselves I'd like to know more about this I'm also curious what happens to the resonance of graphene at the edges,hemija,4449
4431,Oxygen is a rather boring element It has only two allotropes Oxygen and Ozone Oxygen has a double bond and Ozone has a delocalised cloud giving rise to two 1 5 bonds On the other hand Sulphur has many stable allotropes and a bunch of unstable ones as well The variety of allotropes is mainly due to the ability of Sulphur to catenate But Sulphur does not have a stable diatomic allotrope at room temperature I personally would expect diatomic sulphur to be more stable than diatomic Oxygen due to the possibility of $p\pi -d\pi$ back-bonding So why do Sulphur and Oxygen have such opposite properties with respect to their ability to catenate,hemija,4432
4436,Ortho- and parahydrogen are two forms of the $\ce{H2}$ molecule that are distinguished by their pairing or antipairing of nuclear spins giving rise to metastable singlet (ortho-) and triplet (para-) states This constitutes an example of nuclear spin isomerism Whilst the thermal properties of these two species are different my understanding is that their chemical properties are essentially identical Are there any examples of this kind of isomerism having nontrivial implications for chemical reactivity,hemija,4437

4442,The R/S naming system for stereocenters relies on the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules to rank the four substituents of a stereocenter; the R or S name is then attributed depending on the spatial orientation of the ranked substituents While this is mostly used for asymmetric carbon atoms it holds true of other stereocenters with four substituents However nitrogen and phosphorus atoms can also act as stereocenters if the inversion of their configuration is blocked (e g because they're in a cyclic molecule) or slowed enough (e g because of bulky substituents) Apparently these stereocenters are also labelled in R/S fashion Examples I found include Tröger's base (above is the (5S 11S)-enantiomer below is the (5R 11R)-enantiomer) and DIPAMP Having said that I can't find any reference as to how the R/S naming scheme is applied to these tetrahedral stereocenters which don't have four substituents but a lone electron pair and three substituents instead I assume that the same scheme can be followed if one considers the lone pair as the lowest-ranked substituent but I can't find any canonical reference as to that So how are such stereocenters named What authoritative reference can I find on this topic,hemija,4443

4456,I'm familiar with the concept of a reaction coordinate from high school chemistry as some generic conformational parameter that all of the intermediate states of a chemical reaction lie upon Recently though I've seen some presentations where chemists presented plots of the free energy with respect to two reaction coordinates and my understanding is that the plot was of a measurement (I could be wrong though) What exactly does the reaction coordinate mean What does it mean to have more than one reaction coordinate for the same reaction Is the free energy as a function of the reaction coordinate a measurable quantity,hemija,4514
4459,While reading this paper (suggested by @Janice here ) I came across the following line Surface reconstruction is known to be extremely important for Si the material of 20th century electronics However surface reconstruction has been much less studied for graphite One of the reasons might be graphite's limited use in electronics because fabrication of ordered graphite substrates is difficult (emphasis mine) I've always believed that graphite isn't much used in semiconductor tech since it isn't a metalloid and conducts in an entirely different manner probably making doping not work This reason is new to me but quite interesting I can sort of guess why fabrication of ordered graphite substrates is difficult — I'm not too sure though At any rate I'd like to know more about it Exactly why is such fabrication difficult,hemija,18394
4462,Just some while ago I was burning a box of cardboard in my backyard and I saw a very curious phenomenon I saw that as the cardboard box started burning it started to curl Up after a while as I came back to check if the fire was out I saw that though the cardboard box wasn't a box any longer but individual sides/faces of the box had retained their ridges and texture though they had tuned greyish white and crumbly My questions Why did the cardboard start to curl up as it began to burn Why did it retain its texture if not shape and size,hemija,4465
4464,Most molecules containing nitrogen atoms in trigonal pyramid configuration undergo a relatively fast process of inversion at room temperature On the other hand the free energy barrier for phosphines sulfoniums and sulfoxides are high enough that they are optically stable the rate of racemization is slow at room temperature I wonder what effect is responsible for this difference in behaviour (the larger energy barrier) I expect that it has to do with the size of the central atom (N being one row higher than P and S) but is that all there is to it And how does size impact the free energy barrier for the inversion energetically or entropically (or both of course),hemija,4542

4468,I just bought a heat bag from store and it has special property It is made up of transparent plastic bag and transparent unknown liquid inside when sold There is a tiny circular metal piece in there If you bend the metal piece crystalization will occur and release quite a lot of heat The crystalization will spread out and change all the liquid into crystals When the hardened plastic bag cool down you need to put it into boiling water and the crystals will dissolve and become liquid again What is more interesting I tried to heat it up but not letting all the crystal dissolve take it out of the boiling water and assume it is ready for the next use However the half-dissolved liquid/crystal turns into all crystals again (without me bending the metal piece) I am guessing the transformation was not complete and the process was reverted Did the Japanese invent this material,hemija,4469

4493,Assume a cubic diamond crystal with hydrogen-terminated surface bonds The terminating hydrogen atoms will form pairs that are geometrically close together in alternating diagonal pairs (think of the rectangles on corrugated walking steel) Next picture a formaldehyde molecule being pushed oxygen-first into one of these terminating hydrogen pairs If the oxygen atom can be made to react with the hydrogen pair a water molecule would be expelled and the remaining $\ce{CH2}$ group would presumably bond to the two bonds of the diamond lattice If you repeat this process over the entire cubic face the result will be a new layer of diamond that is terminated with the same paired hydrogen atoms as the original layer The entire layer-growth process thus in principle could be repeated indefinitely resulting in a diamond grown at or near room temperature from an aqueous or other low-temperature solution Question Can anyone think of a fundamental reason why the above process or some variant of it could not be used to grow diamond crystals at room temperature (A variant might start with carbohydrate units larger than $\ce{OCH2}$ for example ) One or more geometrically sophisticated catalyst molecules would be required Each catalyst molecule would snag carry and orient a formaldehyde molecules onto some part of the textured surfaces provided by the cubic diamond face such as the face itself or along a growth edge I did this a long time ago in high school but my recollection is that the reaction should be mildly exothermic But even if it is not energy-source molecules (think of the role of ATP in living systems) could provide energy to enable an endothermic reaction So thoughts anyone Is there any deep reason why this approach to room-temperature or near-room-temperature diamond synthesis is clearly not possible,hemija,5149

4531,In my textbook for calculating the percentage dissociation of $HF$ for the given equation $$\ce{HF + H2O &lt;-&gt; H3O+ + F-}$$ The solution is Initial Concentrations $$[\ce{HF}] = 0 08M \ \ce{[H3O+]} = 0 \ \ce{[F- ]}= 0$$ Equilibrium concentrations $$[\ce{HF}] = 0 08M - x \ \ce{[H3O+]} = x \ \ce{[F- ]}= x$$ I am not able to undestand why $x$ is subtracted from 0 08 and not $cx$ [ where $x$ is the degree of dissociation] I tried solving the same problem taking $cx$ but not able to get the solution can anybody explain the difference to me I have tried asking a similar question earlier too but it is really hard for me to get my head around this concept,hemija,4532
4534,This is a question that has been bugging me for over 15 years In high school while studying elements our teacher showed us a clear white rock or element It was simply flat on both sides but when placed on a sheet of paper would transfer the letters from the page beneath it to the top surface of the rock I remember being amazed by this rock but could not remember what it was Now I am working on a creative project and would love to see if I can incorporate the material in my design,hemija,4536
4537,Inspired by this question I'm wondering why arsenous acid is frequently denoted $\ce{H3AsO3}$ as opposed to $\ce{As(OH)3}$ which would appear to more accurately reflect its connectivity [edit] I feel like such a doofus forgetting about $\ce{H2SO4}$ $\ce{H3PO4}$ etc Great discussion people,hemija,4538
4539,I am currently reading the CRC Handbook of Phosphorus-31 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Data by John C Tebby (CRC Press 1991) and on several figures (ex pages 9 to 14) there is a caption that reads along these lines $^{31}$P NMR chemical shifts of three coordinate (?3 ?3) phosphorus compounds (Tables B to E ) What does the (?3 ?3) signify I've not seen that notation before and it is on the captions of some of the charts I need,hemija,4541
4540,I'm attempting to oxidize a substance with potassium permanganate and I was wondering what organic solvents I have at my disposal The compound is soluble in chloroform and ethanol but obviously those would not do well with a powerful oxidizing agent The phase-transfer catalyst I'm going to employ is tetra-n-butylammonium bromide,hemija,4571
4543,Oobleck is basically a mixture of cornstarch and water It has the interesting property of going hard when pressure is applied For example it feels like a liquid when you swirl your fingers through it but it becomes hard for a second if you punch it The common explanation for this is that the starch-water mixture is a suspension and the starch particles lock when pressure is applied What exactly is the mechanism of this locking,hemija,4545
4544,Copper sulphate in its hydrated form is crystalline whereas the anhydrous form is amorphous Gypsum has a similar story-- on heating the crystalline dihydrate we get an amorphous hemihydrate (Gypsum in fact has two different crystalline forms of the dihydrate and has an anhydrous form as well) I've never really grasped how the water makes it crystalline I suspect it has to do with the relative sizes of the compounds being re-compensated by ligands but I'm not sure How does the water affect/create the crystalline properties,hemija,4547
4546,Well I have seen many comical acts where people balance a spoon (or a fork) on different parts of the face like on the tip of the nose forehead etc The do this by blowing moist air (see below) and immediately putting it on the face So i wanted to know is what is the force that temporarily binds the skin to the fork I doubt it's friction or Van Der Walls force Can someone please clarify this for me Is it some sort of chemical bond Some addition Also another method of doing this was to rub the concave part of the spoon on the tip of the nose This article states how to do it properly In the 2 nd point it states Eventually you will feel a slight tendency for the spoon to resist on the downstroke What is this resisting tendency,hemija,8477
4549,I am confused about the justification for the corrections to the ideal gas law in the Van der Waals equation $$p=\frac{nRT}{V-nb}-a(\frac{n}{V})^2$$ I understand that the equation attempts to correct for attractive and repulsive forces between molecules and that at high volumes the corrections are negligible at intermediate volumes the $V-nb$ correction dominates (since attractions are dominant and this shrinks the volume as should occur for attractions) and at low volumes the $a(\frac{n}{V})^2$ correction dominates since repulsions are dominant However the 7th edition of Atkins' and de Paula's Physical Chemistry justifies part of this equation as follows The repulsive interactions are taken into account by supposing that they cause the molecules to behave as small but impenetrable spheres The nonzero volume of the molecules implies that instead of moving in a volume $V$ they are restricted to a smaller volume $V-nb$ This argument suggests that the perfect gas law $p=nRT/V$ should be replaced by $$p=\frac{nRT}{V-nb}$$ when repulsions are significant I am confused by this argument-- what exactly is the definition of 'volume' here They seem to be saying that it is the empty space around the gas molecules but it seems to me that volume should be defined as the space 'taken up' by the gas Why should the space taken up by the particles themselves be subtracted This isn't done for solids or liquids as far as I know These thoughts have also made me realize that I'm not quite sure what it means for a gas to 'take up' space Does anyone have a rigorous definition of gas volume EDIT The exchange with Chris in comments has raised further questions It now seems to me that the $V-nb$ correction actually accounts for repulsions rather than attractions I think I was incorrect in thinking that the $V-nb$ correction dominated at intermediate volumes and $a(\frac{n}{V})^2$ at low volumes If $V-nb$ is for repulsions then it should dominate at low volumes but I can't tell from the equation which correction will actually be dominant Also I am now wondering whether it even makes sense to connect one correction with repulsions and one with attractions EDIT Follow-up questions for F'x - I thought that 'density' meant mass/volume Is the use of it to represent the inverse of molar volume (as you have used it) common - Where is the phase-transition in the red van der Waals curve - I am still a little unclear on gas volume Are the 'volume available to the gas' and 'volume of the gas' the same You say it's the same as the shape of the container but aren't we subtracting the volume of the actual gas particles from that The $V$ term represents the volume of the gas correct And $V-nb$ represents the 'volume available to the gas',hemija,4720
4550,2D spectrum take up a large amount of hard disk space At my last lab it was standard practice to delete the imaginary portions of the spectrum with xfb n (We used TopSpin) and if needed later to regenerate it from the Real part of the data with a Hilbert transform (Related the TopSpin Commands and References ~pg P-233 in version 2 1 2) My first question If the raw data is still stored in the ser file (TopSpin Commands and References v2 1 2 pg P-8) why can't you just reprocess the raw data Is all the data not there (I suspect this somewhat as those files are much much smaller then the processed files and TopSpin processes 2D spectra as it acquires them unlike 1D spectra) My second (highly related) question Is there a downside to regenerating the imaginary data from the real data Is it a perfect replication of the original data or is it an approximation Why do we ever bother to store this data if we can recreate it at any time,hemija,4551
4554,Most of the existing software I know (like VMD or Pymol) say that they can be used to create PDF files with 3D representations of molecules actual 3D models which you can rotate inside the Adobe Acrobat viewer However they all require the use of “Adobe Acrobat Pro 9 Extended” for its 3D capture feature From what I can read this feature does not exist any more in Acrobat X and was transferred to a separate product Tetra4D which doesn't work on Mac OS So how can I produce PDF files including 3D molecular models using free (or better open source) tools,hemija,4557
4555,It's a common cooking advice if you want a somewhat softer caramel add some lemon juice to the sugar To help prevent the caramel from crystallizing you can add an acid to the sugar before you begin add about half a tablespoon of lemon juice to each cup of sugar and mix it with your hands But how does it work,hemija,4556

4559,Here is my interpretation when asked to By drawing arrows in the appropriate boxes complete the outer electron structures for Cu and Cu 2+ I had no problem in drawing out the electron structure but am a little confused by the orientation of my arrows I understand that each normal box has to have arrows in opposing directions to represent the opposite spins on the electrons but the mark scheme defines which way round they want them to go Source OCR GCE Chemistry B F334 June 2011 Markscheme pg 11 Ordinarily I would have said that whether you go up or down first (or even consistently) is irrelevant and arbitrary but the comment in the guidance ALLOW single arrow in either direction suggests to me that with the paired arrows the order of directions matter Is there any chemical reason for putting the downwards spin arrow first I would happily accept by convention as a reason but I just want to be sure that I'm not missing anything chemically relevant,hemija,4564
4563,This is my first time taking a $\ce{{}^{13}C-NMR}$ spectrum and while I'm aware the signal to noise ratio is much lower compared to $\ce{{}^{1}H-NMR}$ I didn't realize it was quite this bad I took a spectrum and I only see the $\ce{CDCl3}$ triplet What concentration range is generally appropriate given say 256 scans (10 minutes on our machines ) or is it rare to see any good results after without drastically increasing the scan time Spectrum for reference (taken on a 300 MHz Varian Mercury),hemija,4583

4569,In the borax bead test we take a crystal of borax and then heat it A small loop is made in the end of a platinum or nichrome wire (as used in the flame test) and heated in a Bunsen flame until red hot It is then dipped into powdered borax and the adhering solid is held in the hottest part of the flame where it swells up as it loses its water of crystallization and then shrinks forming a colourless transparent glass-like bead (a mixture of sodium metaborate and boric anhydride) Whenever I've done the experiment I've noticed that the process looks like this It heats up in a second in this time there are no visible changes It starts expanding/blooming Bubbles appear and little pseudopodia(closest work I can think of) of borax flail about This takes approx five seconds At the end of this the borax looks like whipped cream that's been well whipped The thing suddenly contracts into a tiny bead Now as mentioned in the quote basically borax loses its water of crystallization and then decomposes into $\ce{NaBO2 +B2O3}$ the small bead The flailing about is probably due to steam escaping But the reaction proceeds in such an interesting manner I can't help but think that there's something else going on as well What are the details of the mechanism of the borax bead preparation reaction,hemija,4603
4572,Some NMR experiments can be halted partway through the acquisition and still give perfectly valid results The traditional 1H experiment for example Others like a Saturation Transfer Difference Spectrum will have errors in the magnitude of the peaks in it if it is halted due to the fact it uses groups of pulses and takes the difference of between them Can the standard proton-proton NOESY pulse sequence be halted halfway through and give a usable spectrum or will this introduce artifacts,hemija,4582
4573,I want to know which are the most stable furan resonance structures I know that structure number 1 is the most stable but which one comes after,hemija,4581
4574,I know that anthocyanins are a class of compounds responsible for the purple colors found in flower petals Anthocyanins (also anthocyans; from Greek ????? (anthos) = flower + ?????? (kyanos) = blue) are water-soluble vacuolar pigments that may appear red purple or blue depending on the pH (same reference as above) The anthocyanins when extracted from flower petals with water can be used as acid/base indicators producing red colors in acid and blue in neutral solutions (in basic solutions they turn green yellow and then become colorless) When I've done the extractions some red petals produce a red color in acid and maintain the red color at higher pH than purple flowers (see plate below) but some red flowers produce colors that seem to follow the normal progression Row 2 from the top was a purple flower row 3 a red flower and row 4 also a red flower (pH values start at 2 on the left and increase by 1 pH unit as you move right by adding the water extracts to buffer samples in the wells ) So are there other classes of compounds responsible for the red and yellow colors found in flowers Can the red colors that give a normal anthocyanin pH response arise from pigments held in an acidic environment in the plant (That may be a biology question but I'm interested in the chemistry side of where the color comes from ),hemija,4587
4575,When purchasing chemicals from Sigma Fisher or wherever there are often -grade 's attached to their description like reagent-grade technical-grade analytical-grade or more niche-sounding biotech-grade HPLC-grade DNA grade (DNase free perhaps ) Is there some sort of standard for what these actually mean or are they arbitrary differing from supplier to supplier or even chemical to chemical Beyond the 'niche' grades is there a common order of purity between the others or do they depend on the types of impurities,hemija,4576
4577,I am trying to build a system of two connected chambers one of which is also connected to a cuvette so I can perform a spectrometry experiment with different concentrations of $\ce{KNO3}$ solution In its simplest form the cuvette and the first chamber would hold solution at the same concentration while the second chamber would hold solution of higher concentration I would perform one experiment open a valve between the chambers and wait for the concentration to equilibrate before performing the next experiment My advisor suggested this system and said that the equilibration time would likely be on the order of minutes I used this equation to calculate equilibration time between two chambers $$ t = \frac{\Delta m \cdot l_{v}}{A_{v} \cdot D \cdot 10^6 \cdot \Delta c} $$ where $t$ = equilibration time in s $\Delta m$ = the difference in mass of $\ce{KNO3}$ between the chambers in g $l_{v}$ = the length of the valve in m $A_{v}$ = the orifice area of the valve in m^2 $D$ = the mutual diffusion constant of $\ce{KNO3}$ and $\ce{H2O}$ which is on the order of 10^-9 m^2/s $\Delta c$ = the difference in concentration between the chambers in g/cm^3 the factor of 10^6 is to convert between g/cm^3 and g/m^3 For a cylindrical valve 1 cm long and 2 cm in radius (improbably short and wide) and chamber volumes 95 cm^3 and 400 cm^3 this gives an equilibration time of 4 7 days This is much more than I was expecting I can reduce the sizes of the chambers to decrease the time demand but I would prefer to keep them as large as I can to increase the final concentration that can be achieved in the cuvette Is there something obvious that I'm missing in this calculation Is there a better way to do it Edit The equation above was derived by equating the mass flux $j_{m}$ with its definition from Fick's first law (using $c$ as mass/volume rather than amount/volume) $$ j_{m}=\frac{\Delta m}{A_{v}\cdot \Delta t}=D\cdot\frac{\Delta c}{\Delta x} $$ I know that strictly the RHS should contain $\frac{\delta c}{\delta x}$ rather than $\frac{\Delta c}{\Delta x}$ Does this approximation make much difference For now I am also making the fairly large assumptions that the volumes of solution in each chamber do not change and that the density of the solution is independent of concentration I think I can include these considerations later on This is an actual system that I need to build (well ask our machine shop to build for me) and I need to have a good idea of the best valve sizes to use as they have a significant effect on the overall structure,hemija,4618

4584,In one variation of the Iodine Clock Demonstration you add two colorless solutions together and apparently nothing happens After about 30 seconds to a minute you get an instantaneous change to a dark blue color Solution A is 0 006M $\ce{KIO3}$ and is stable over at least a year or two Solution B is made with starch* 0 2 g of sodium metabisulfite ($\ce{Na2S2O5}$) and 1 mL of 1M $\ce{HCL}$ in 200 mL of water (*starch can be from reagent grade starch or starch from a packing peanut or from laundry starch bought at the grocery store The concentration of the starch ends up at about 0 05% w/v) Solution B must be made up no more than 24 hours in advance or the reaction doesn't work the blue color doesn't form or the timing of the reaction is way off depending on how old the reagent is My question is what happens in solution B that makes it unstable and is there an easy way to stabilize it so that I could have the chemicals needed for the demo ready on the shelf The reactions that happen in the demo are $$\ce{S2O5^2- + H2O -&gt; 2 HSO3-}$$ $$\ce{IO3- + 3 HSO3- -&gt; 3 SO4^2- + I- + 3 H+} (slow)$$ $$\ce{IO3- + 8 I- + 6 H+ -&gt; 3 I3- + 3 H2O} (slow)$$ $$\ce{I3- + HSO3- + H2O -&gt; 3 I- + SO4^2- + 3 H+} (fast)$$ $$\ce{2 I3- + starch -&gt; blue complex + I-} (fast)$$ I don't see anything in these that tell me why the metabisulfite/$\ce{HCl}$/starch reagent is unstable ( Ref for demo and reactions ),hemija,4585

4590,I'm reading a paper 1 by Sanakis et al that characterises the magnetic coupling in the $\ce{Fe3S4}$ clusters present in bacterial ferredoxin II and beef heart aconitase as arising through something called 'antisymmetric exchange' This looks like it may be a result of the apparent magnetic frustration of the system (three high-spin $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$ ions all in essentially identical environments all antiferromagnetically coupled with respect to their neighbours) The paper says that the clusters have a S=1/2 ground state which is incompatible with a broken-symmetry model The wikipedia article on antisymmetric exchange (all four sentences of it) is not particularly edifying I'm hoping an expert can explain what antisymmetric exchange is and what causes it as I've not heard of it be before The paper also notes that the exchange situation in the cluster gives rise to three slightly different $J_{ij}$ values (again despite the symmetry of the ions) and terms this ' J-strain ' This makes me doubt that for instance 'antisymmetric' is being used as a synonym for 'antiferromagnetic' [Edit] Here's an example of the general connectivity of this kind of $\ce{Fe3S4}$ cluster (based on D Gigas FdII (PDB entry 1F2G )) The cluster comprises a hemicubane $\ce{S_{Cys}}$ denotes a cysteinyl sulfur (1) Sanakis Y ; Macedo A L ; Moura I ; Moura J J G ; Papaefthymiou V ; Münck E ; Evidence for Antisymmetric Exchange in Cuboidal $\ce{[3Fe-4S]^+}$ Clusters ; J Am Chem Soc ; 2000 122 pp 11855-11863,hemija,13456

4594,Carbon is well known to form single double and triple $\ce{C-C}$ bonds in compounds There is a recent report (2012) that carbon forms a quadruple bond in diatomic carbon $\ce{C2}$ The excerpt below is taken from that report The fourth bond seems pretty odd to me $\ce{C2}$ and its isoelectronic molecules $\ce{CN+}$ BN and $\ce{CB-}$ (each having eight valence electrons) are bound by a quadruple bond The bonding comprises not only one ?- and two ?-bonds but also one weak ‘inverted’ bond which can be characterized by the interaction of electrons in two outwardly pointing sp hybrid orbitals According to Shaik the existence of the fourth bond in $\ce{C2}$ suggests that it is not really diradical If $\ce{C2}$ were a diradical it would immediately form higher clusters I think the fact that you can isolate $\ce{C2}$ tells you it has a barrier small as it may be to prevent that Molecular orbital theory for dicarbon on the other hand predicts a C-C double bond in $\ce{C2}$ with 2 pairs of electrons in $\pi$ bonding orbitals and a bond order of two The bond dissociation energies (BDE) of $\ce{B2 C2}$ and $\ce{N2}$ show increasing BDE consistent with single double and triple bonds ( Ref ) So this model of the $\ce{C2}$ molecule seems quite reasonable My questions since this is most definitely not my area of expertise Is dicarbon found naturally in any quantity and how stable is it Is it easy to make in the lab (The Wikipedia article reports it in stellar atmospheres electric arcs etc ) Is there good evidence for the presence of a quadruple bond in $\ce{C2}$ that wouldn't be equally well explained by double bonding,hemija,5041

4608,What are the advantages and disadvantages of the various types of condensers commonly found in the laboratory Obviously more intricate pieces of glassware are more costly but assuming they are all available why would one use a Dimroth condenser vs a Friedrichs when refluxing something I've heard that Graham condensers are to be avoided when refluxing due to the possibility of clogging and yet it is still very common - when is it appropriate to use one Illustration made with ChemDraw Feel free to reference other designs but please attach a schematic for clarity Edit This question was motivated by an organic preparation which involved the bromination of an alkene in boiling water Bromine has a boiling point of 58 8 &deg;C and on top of that the reaction was exothermic It was difficult to avoid the loss of Br 2 gas with your typical Allihn condenser but the increased cooling capacity provided by a Friedrichs returned Br 2 back to the flask as it was produced Also while the Friedrichs forces vapors up a spiral path the path itself is wide and in my condenser at least there was a bit of leeway for liquid to drop down the sides helping to prevent blockages I didn't try a Graham condenser but I imagine a much slower rate of addition would be supported by this condenser,hemija,4614
