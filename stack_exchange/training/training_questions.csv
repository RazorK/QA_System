4,I think actually the first row is needed is a barometric height formula for the mix of gases The main problem I can see the curves describing the minimal energy (kinetic + gravitational/centrifugal) won't be any more a simple derivative but a functional equation I think this or similar equations could be useful in very separate areas (isotope separation estimating high atmosphere components of planets etc ) Despite I couldn't find anything with google about this So the question is we have a high gas mixture in constant g gravity and T temperature We known the p1 p2 partial pressures of the gases on the h=0 Of course we know every relevant constants of the gases too What is their minimal-energy isothermic height-dependent partial pressure function pn(h),inzinjerstvo,248

22,I recently had a project where I made an aluminum linkage (similar to a scissor lift) operated by linear actuators Aluminum pieces were fabricated from 6061 standard aluminum stock 6mm (0 25 inch) thick The bars are at most 750x75mm (30x3 ) The application was mostly cosmetic (for a special effect) rather than lifting or exerting much force I used shoulder bolts with a nylon washer between the aluminum pieces to reduce friction and standard zinc-plated steel washers on the exterior sides The problem I encountered was tightening the bolt too much would result in too much friction whereas too loose would result in one of the aluminum pieces coming slightly off the shoulder of the bolt skewing and causing similar problems What would be a better way to create a reliable pivot point that doesn't require constant adjustment I put together this illustration as an example per Nick's suggestion,inzinjerstvo,83
26,As far I know the depleted fuel cells are crushed and solved in nitric acid What is coming after that This nitric acid should probably contain a very wide spectrum of different salts (practically all of the elements between 35-65 and yet a lot of transurans and a lot of uranium (both of 235 ad 238) and plutonium) To reach an efficient reprocessing the uranium (or at least the actinid elements) should be somehow separated from this solution But AFAIK they have very different chemical properties How is it possible to separate only the transuranic materials,inzinjerstvo,43
28,I am wondering if there is a spring strong enough and light enough to inflate an airtight membrane so that it floats at Standard Temp &amp; Pressure As an example a 10cm cylinder would displace just under 1 gram of air but a cylindrical spring would have to oppose 162kg of atmospheric force in that configuration Is there such a thing as a 162kg 10cm cylindric spring that weighs less than 1 gram But that's just one spring design More generally what spring designs provide the highest rate/weight ratio What are the current practical limits on spring rate vs spring mass and using what materials,inzinjerstvo,111

33,It's true that most bridges are two directional But three way bridges are pretty rare globally I can understand why there wouldn't be many for rivers but if bridges are designed based on the lie of the surrounding ground why wouldn't there be a large number of non-river sites that would support such bridges On the other hand three out of the world's bridges exist in Michigan (and only ten or so elsewhere in the United States) What is it about the land topography or other features of Michigan that cause it to have a disproportionate number of the country's and world's three way bridges,inzinjerstvo,75

66,I know that my input signal contains a main sinusoidal signal and I know its frequency but not its amplitude Until now I have been successfully using the least-squares method to generate a sinusoidal signal with the least difference from my input However this method breaks down when faced with slightly more complicated input signals where the noise is big enough to disturb the list square As a consequence it's not efficient anymore What are some other ways I can accomplish this filtering that don't have the same issue,inzinjerstvo,70
68,I have a 2mm thick steel plate which is 300mm long and 30mm wide supported at either end It supports a weight-bearing wheel that can roll along the plate It currently supports the maximum weight that I expect it to support when the wheel is in the middle but it flexes a little bit too much Would making it wider help to support the weight and increase its stiffness or do I need to make it thicker Also is there a way to calculate how the stiffness will change with the thickness (or width if that would affect it),inzinjerstvo,69
73,A highly desirable property of metals like gallium and indium is that they are able to wet glass Normally as metals they wouldn't be able to form an airtight seal when in contact with glass But they are able to do so and they can be used in applications where an airtight seal is required (e g vacuum gaskets) That said indium and gallium are somewhat expensive (at press time around 700 USD/kg and 250 USD/kg respectively) Industrial compounds that also have similar properties such as Galinstan (even though the glass still needs a wetting with gallium oxide first) aren't much better What are some metal substances that are both cost-effective and able to wet glass with an airtight seal that can be used in industrial applications,inzinjerstvo,201

84,I need to pump a thick slurry from a tank The slurry can be pumped but won't flow well enough that I can use a suction pump from outside the tank Normally I'd use a centrifugal immersion pump that can be drawn from the tank for service But with the thick slurry I need to use a PD pump One option that I'm looking at is a monopump housed in a long pipe so the rotor/stator packet is submerged and operated by a long shaft in the pipe But this will probably get expensive and I'm open for other options Another consideration is ease of service the immersion pump linked above would have to be lifted with a crane out of the tank for service The application is agricultural / bio-energy; tank depth is 4m So I'm looking for a PD pump that is capable of pumping thick slurries can be put into my sump pump and retrieved for service with low effort (which probably rules out long driveshafts) I'm mostly hunting for ideas no need for a concrete product recommendation,inzinjerstvo,118
86,For one-off bespoke electronic products or ventures on low budgets what is the cheapest way of ensuring the product conforms to EMI/EMC requirements of CE marking This can be at design time and / or throughout the manufacturing process Examples A small-run electronic microprocessor based controller (using a CE-Marked zero-cross solid state relay) intended to switch on or off a 2kW load such as a consumer grade 240V 2kW blower heater A one-off CNC machine that utilizes CE-marked low voltage motors and servos and is controlled by a microcontroller and miscellaneous circuitry A new venture into producing LED lighting with controllers - typically switching 10W loads; using PWM to control brightness; controlled by a micro-controller; using SMD LEDs and a CE-marked switched-mode 24V 3A PSU Obviously there must be logical principles which one can apply to allow one to bypass other expensive conforming methods For example connecting two CE-marked appliances to each other where they are intended to do so would most likely not need any further testing The problem is that for more complicated scenarious getting products approved by external companies that provide CE-marking assessments can be incredibly expensive Also I have not found any particularly affordable equipment/methods to carry out EMI/EMC testing - and not being an expert in EMI/EMC means I would not be confident about using such equipment effectively,inzinjerstvo,90

100,Prince Rupert's Drops are glass objects created by dripping molten glass into cold water While the outside of the drop quickly cools the inside remains hot for a longer time When it eventually cools it shrinks setting up very large compressive stresses on the surface The result is a sort of toughened glass you can hammer the drop head without damaging it but a scratch on the tail leads to an explosive disintegration Check out this video So is it possible to build spherical Prince Rupert's drops And if so how One example of an application is as a replacement for traditional ball bearing spheres There will be improvements in wear resistance and maximum loads tolerable and a glass sphere would cost less anyway,inzinjerstvo,239

150,As I heard the life expectancy of photovoltaic cells is normally some decades as so This is very long regarding their high cost it has significant (negative) effect on the total costs Why do they age I can see the only possibility which could damage their atomic structure and this is the very high energetic ultraviolet (or even soft röntgen) photon spectrum of the sun (which is only a small part of its power) And I think these photons could be maybe easily filtered out by a transparent plastic layer over the silicon Thus why do the solar cells age and what happens in them on the atomic level,inzinjerstvo,159

165,Pontoon bridges differ from traditional bridges in that they are supported not by structures anchored to the floor of the body being spanned but by floating pontoons that are connected by a more rigid structure that supports a roadway They're often used by militaries to provide a temporary crossing point but they're also used for permanent civilian crossings I would assume that they make it easier to cross larger bodies of water because there is less structure to be secured below the surface In areas of deep water support structures can become unfeasibly large These larger spans could though make the pontoon bridges susceptible to damage from strong winds and currents Are there plans to use pontoon bridges to cross long distances,inzinjerstvo,177
166,By modern computers I mean electronic programmable computers such as those that were developed about the middle of the 20th century My understanding is that early computers such as Charles Babbage's calculating machines worked mainly on mechanical principles like a modern abacus Apparently later machines were more electronically based I'm talking about computers that evolved from using vacuum tubes to transistors to integrated circuits and ultimately silicon chips What engineering advances enabled the above transition to occur from physical means (e g vacuum tubes) to electronic means (e g transistors) when it did (middle 20th century),inzinjerstvo,167

180,I'm working on design of a 3D movement drive (for 3D printers/CNC mills etc) using DC motors and helical drive A DC motor drives the leadscrew actuator which supports the working elements (head table or head bridge) The current of the motor shaft -> position of the driven element is read with optical encoder (I can derive speed acceleration momentum etc from that ) I can read the current (voltage across a fixed low resistance in series with the motor) and the voltage across the motor terminals resulting in measurement of the power -> torque I can drive the power supplied to the motor through PWM For optimal drive I should maintain movement speed as close as possible to given (right for the used machining parameters) and as I'm machining material the resistance of the material against the tool will change in more or less unexpected pattern This is pretty simple with stepper motors where we just assume the output directly follows the input In case of DC motor though the control must be much more reactive increasing power as torque rises What control algorithm would allow me to maintain movement speed closest to preset - meeting the additional condition restricting or rapidly minimizing exceeding the preset speed; rapidly reduced load as the head exits material could result in speed increase and drive the head into a neighbour element damaging the work piece (please note this is one of the questions that take long rather than short answers; control algorithms in automatics is a subject of good several semesters of study and choosing and explaining the control algorithm meeting specified criteria is bound to require some work ),inzinjerstvo,181

214,Austenite is non magnetic while $\alpha$-ferrite and pearlite are magnetic ( Magnetic properties of pearlite vary as a function of carbon content ) If a strong magnetic field is applied in a particular direction while the steel is being quenched (rather austenite is being quenched ) would the grain structure change Is it possible to get superior grain structure and hence tougher steel by application of cyclic magnetic field My speculation is that at the eutectoid point while quenching the steel as low carbon zone of pearlite has more permeability that zone should align itself to the strong magnetic field by pushing the carbon in orthogonal direction so grain boundaries should take a different shape Will it actually happen,inzinjerstvo,252

217,If I install a small air compressor/engine generator and tank in my garage and I charge it up at night when electricity costs $\frac{5 4p}{kWh}$ and use it during the day to power my house when electricity costs $\frac{12 5p}{kWh}$ would this be able to save money on the electricity bill or not The tank engine and generator should be sized to charge up over 7 hours between 01 00 and 08 00 and release the energy during the other 17 hours of the day I'm assuming that regardless of when during the day the energy is actually released it is either used by me or goes back into the grid and runs the meter backwards to offset my day-usage,inzinjerstvo,220
218,I was looking at high pressure pipes and their pressure ratings I'd like to know how these pressure ratings are determined I assume that pipes are tested until failure and the failure pressure is multiplied by some safety factor to determine its 'rated' pressure but is there a formula to calculate what the failure pressure should be before testing it (based on the material wall thickness diameter or other measurements of the pipe),inzinjerstvo,221
223,Weight lifters will use the term one rep maximum in order to refer to the maximum amount of weight that they can lift one time The one rep max is often used as a proxy for how strong someone is (or isn't) Recreational lifters other types of athletes and the general population rarely bother with testing themselves in order to determine their maximum strength From a human factors and usability point of view it can be useful to know what the average maximum strength of a population is so that design can take those limitations into account Please see the footnotes 1 2 3 for some practical applications of this question My question is if it's possible to estimate a person's maximum strength for a given activity by seeing how many repetitions they can complete at a lower weight For example if someone can bench-press 100 lbs 10 times in a row can that be used to estimate the maximum amount they could bench-press once If so does that estimation model hold consistently across activity types hold consistently across increasing amounts of weight hold consistently across age and gender distributions 1 An entertaining example amusement park / carnival attractions can be designed differently in order to accommodate the various distributions of strength 2 A mobility example aids for the disabled can be enhanced if it's found that their maximum strength is below the threshold for a device 3 A diagnostics example restraints can be designed just to the maximum of a particular demographic's abilities in order to provide a more comforting or friendly appearance This provides a humanizing touch while maintaining the accuracy of the diagnostic test,inzinjerstvo,225
224,Cut-in cut-out thermostats are commonly used with refrigeration devices in order to hold a consistent temperature range Their general operations is such that when the temperature by the probe reaches a particular temperature set as the upper limit the thermostat cuts-in and the compressor is turned on providing cold air And when the temperature by the probe reaches the lower temperature set point the thermostat cuts-out and turns off the compressor What materials are used in within an analog or mechanical cut-in cut-out thermostat Likewise how is the internal circuit designed such that one probe feeds both cut circuits and what control is put in place for the cut-out to override the cut-in signal To help scope this question based upon the materials used in an analog cut-in cut-out thermostat would it be reasonable to attempt to test and adjust the set points of a thermostat by using jars of water at known temperatures and measuring the output off of the relay within the thermostat,inzinjerstvo,228
226,Some dc motors can be used as generators as well by applying mechanical torque to the output shaft to induce a current However even if a dc motor can do this I imagine they were not designed for this purpose and thus perform less efficiently when used as a generator rather than as a motor In my admittedly naive understanding dc generators and dc motors are essentially the same machinery but with inputs and outputs reversed This leads me to believe that some other design considerations are used to make one direction more efficient than the other How differently are dc generators and dc motors designed to make one direction of input/output more efficient than the other What can one do electrically or mechanically to improve the efficiency in either direction In particular I'm interested in converting a dc motor into a generator and want to know how I can improve its efficiency in converting mechanical energy into electrical energy,inzinjerstvo,451

231,I want to do some very simplified drag calculations on a vessel My hope was that calculating the skin-friction resistance would be enough to get a good estimate of the surge resistance Because wave-making resistance is very speed dependent I assume you can neglect it when the vessel is below a certain speed I also assume that I have to work with Froude numbers instead of velocities to take vessel size into account I have seen Froude numbers below Fn = 0 1 and Fn = 0 2 mentioned in books and on the Internet but if you calculate the velocity for a vessel with a 100 m long waterline you get $$V = 0 1 \cdot \sqrt{9 81\ \text{m/s}^2 \cdot 100\ \text{m}} \approx 3 13\ \text{m/s} \approx 6 08\ \text{knots}$$ $$V = 0 2 \cdot \sqrt{9 81\ \text{m/s}^2 \cdot 100\ \text{m}} \approx 6 26\ \text{m/s} \approx 12 16\ \text{knots}$$ This values seem way too high in my opinion 12 16 knots is almost service speed for some vessels and 6 knots is also quite high Are Fn = 0 1 and Fn = 0 2 reasonable numbers and if not below what Froude numbers should I stay to be able to neglect wave-making resistance,inzinjerstvo,288

245,I have a beam subject to twisting and/or bending forces as well as linear compression force along its main axis It is modelled as an isotropic beam but if anisotropic is not too far off then that's okay too The beam is capable of large deformations such that its maximum deformations are 140 degrees in pure bending 140 degrees in pure twisting 70 degrees bending + 70 degrees twisting What is an applicable nonlinear beam theory I can apply to this problem using equations rather than any software-based solutions I like using the basic undergrad Euler-Bernoulli beam theory but the assumptions make it invalid in this case and I'm looking for something that is in the same vein as far as calculations goes and does not require significantly more advanced mathematics Ideally a theory that reduces the problem to a set of equations that can be solved without requiring multiple pages of tensor calculations that are hard to follow,inzinjerstvo,333
251,When designing reinforced concrete slabs it is common to divide the slab into 'design strips' which are then used to rationalise the reinforcement design along (typically orthogonal) lengths of the slab (also known as the Hilleborg Strip Method) I have mostly seen this approach used in design software (for example SAFE) however they offer little to no advice as to how and where these design strips should be located/sized What rules and considerations do engineers apply when locating/sizing design strips,inzinjerstvo,1831
253,As an example consider a P-T1-system with a PID-controller First look only at the P-T1 system set a $y_r$ and wait a long time - then we take a look on its output $x$ and see that it has still a disturbance $d$ which variates with time (see the plot system output $= x$) In this model the system output is after you wait a long time a constant plus $d(t)$ The next step is to introduce a PID-controller For this loop alone we could just use some experience-based technique like the Ziegler and Nichols procedure to adjust its parameters $K_p$ $K_i$ and $K_d$ optimally If we switch to discrete control loop because the controller is digital we will have one additional parameter The $\Delta t$ at which the controller operates What $\Delta t$ is required for the control loop to diminish the effects of $d$ on the system output The trend will of course be the smaller $\Delta t$ the better but is there a general rule for the maximum $\Delta t$,inzinjerstvo,512

280,For a project I had built a convergent divergent nozzle designed for Mach number = 3 In that project I could know the flow has gone supersonic by seeing the manometer fixed between the throat and the divergent section (drop in pressure as the divergent section acts like a nozzle for the supersonic flow) However this got me thinking If I am to build a nozzle for the propulsion purpose (or any practical purpose) it is not desirable to have holes in it for the manometer in order to maintain the uniform strength My theoretical calculations tell me that the flow should go supersonic and no shock in the nozzle but while building the surface finish geometric tolerances and supply pressure might not be what I expect In that case how do I know if the flow has gone supersonic I thought about following ways So far I haven't tried any of them Using a Pitot tube might not be useful since there will be a bow shock in front of the tube if in case the flow is indeed supersonic (as shown in the figure) which will increase the total pressure We can use Reyleigh pitot tube formula but how to compute static free stream pressure without affecting the flow / nozzle Schlieren Photography If we see oblique shocks / shock diamonds then the inference will be 'flow is supersonic' This will work only when the shock features are super clear,inzinjerstvo,294
283,A friend and I wrote a paper for a fluids class discussing the details (as they relate to fluid dynamics) of constructing a cannon that could shoot a steak fast enough to cook it We quickly discovered (but not quickly enough to change our topic) that our paper was a bit too ambitious for two twenty year old undergrads taking an introductory course in fluid mechanics Nonetheless we still busted out a ballistics simulator a cookbook and a compressive heating calculator and did our best One of the issues that stumped us was compressing the gas we used to launch the steak We chose Helium because it was the least dense gas that probably won't burst into flames (like Hydrogen) Using a compressive heating calculator we found the velocity we needed to shoot the steak and were using Bernoulli's equation to find the pressure we needed to launch at our chosen velocity The issue we ran into was density is dependent on pressure but we needed the density to calculate the pressure needed How does one determine the pressure given the issue above Is it simply several rounds of iteration until an acceptable answer is found,inzinjerstvo,286
289,The modern LED bulbs you can get must convert the standard household supply (for example $240\text{v AC}$ in the UK) into a DC supply at a lower voltage (usually $12\text{v DC}$ I think) for the LED array This is done on a per-bulb basis Does this waste much power in the conversion If all of your bulbs are LED bulbs would it make sense instead to have a $12\text{v DC}$ circuit for lighting around the whole house and LED bulbs without the per-bulb conversion,inzinjerstvo,291
298,This is inspired by a project I undertook for my Physics class last year; I'd like to apply it in the future Background For the project I and a few classmates were required to build a small car powered by any of a number of sources; we opted for a mousetrap that turned two rear wheels on a four-wheel car as it was released Our group's goal was to make the car go as far as possible One problem was that the power source was not constant The lever arm of the trap lifted in an arc for about five seconds then returned to its resting position During this time it propelled the car The car then coasted for the rest of the way In the powered stage we wanted to increase traction The wheels were CDs (because we had a $5 00 budget) which have a tendency to spin out So we attached pieces of cloth to them to get better traction On the second stage however we found that this cloth slowed down the car quite a bit because it dramatically increased friction (as we found out after several hours of testing different combinations) Other groups used duct tape to cover the wheels and some used records which seemed to do slightly better than CDs (though that violated the size restrictions) Cloth seemed to have the best traction though - we didn't have many spinouts The tests were done on a typical classroom floor (I'm not sure what it's made of - linoleum - but it's the same as in almost every school at least in America) In a wheeled vehicle in general - obviously not just a small car powered by a mousetrap - how can I substantially improve traction on the wheels while the power source is on yet reduce friction while it coasts Is it as simple as choosing certain tires or is there a bigger and better engineering solution As a final wrap-up My thought would be to have a shifting center of mass for the vehicle where the powered wheels have a lesser tendency to slip and the front wheels are nearly frictionless During the powered stage the center of mass would be near the back while in the coasting stage it would be near the front This could help reduce the normal force on certain wheels and thereby produce or avoid extra friction,inzinjerstvo,301

313,I live in Louisiana these days in an area that is known for its numerous antebellum plantation homes (circa early 1800s) While touring one of these homes it was clear that almost everything about the house was designed around keeping cool in the summer Some examples 4-meter-high ceilings to allow hot air to rise to the ceiling Floor-to-ceiling windows to allow hot air at the top to escape and cool air to be drawn in at the bottom Porches on the sunny sides of the house to prevent sunlight from entering the windows Large central staircases to allow hot air to rise to the second floor drawing cool air in on the bottom floor Some have a cupola a central observation room at the top of the house again to allow hot air to escape at the top of the house and draw air in from the bottom My question is Given our modern understanding of thermodynamics how could one design a home today to be cooled passively Could we do any better than the plantation owners of the 1800s Let's define cooling as making the house more comfortable for humans This means that it is not only important to reduce the temperature but also to block sunlight and maintain airflow Also if possible it would be very beneficial to extract moisture from the air,inzinjerstvo,319

336,Many commercial and open-source CFD codes implement several closure methods for the non-linear convective acceleration term of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations Common methods (also known as turbulence models ) include Spalart–Allmaras (S–A) k–? (k–epsilon) k–? (k–omega) SST (Menter’s Shear Stress Transport) Reynolds stress equation model Which of these are suitable for CFD simulation of a streamlined vehicle body The purpose of the simulations is to guide the refinement of the body shape to minimize aerodynamic drag forces An exemplary answer would briefly outline the advantages and disadvantages of each method for this simulation application Potentially useful details The vehicle is a small one-person vehicle with approximate dimensions L = 2 5 m W = 0 7 m and H = 0 5 m It will be travelling at speeds ranging from 0 m/s to approximately 12 m/s All three wheels are enclosed by the body envelope and the vehicle has an approximate ground clearance of 15 cm except near the wheels where the body shell extends down to within 1 cm of the road surface Normally aerodynamic forces at these speeds are very nearly negligible but assume that this vehicle is being designed to compete in a Super Mileage competition on a smooth track is very light-weight and uses low friction drivetrain components throughout so the aerodynamic forces have a significant effect on the achievable fuel consumption,inzinjerstvo,344

397,Various materials are implanted within the human body as a result of of medical need Dental implants stabilizing plates arterial stents and orthopedic replacements are all common examples where a material is implanted within the body The typical response of the immune system to any foreign body is to attack the implant If the immune system cannot eradicate the foreign body then it attempts to encapsulate it instead This self-preserving attack from the immune system can lead to implant failure and the likelihood of failure is in part dependent upon the bio-reactivity of the material For example stainless steel has been evaluated to be less reactive than more base steel alloys and titanium has been found to be less reactive than stainless steel How is bio-reactivity characterized and how is it measured over the conditions of a long term implantation,inzinjerstvo,398

406,It's not exactly my area of expertize and I've spent a couple hours ears deep in norms and I'm not really sure if what I found is correct (the figure I found was to the order of 1$\mu$m) When using standard (off-the-shelf not specialized) threaded pin / bolt and a matching nut for a lead-screw actuator what degree of imprecision (free lengthwise movement of the actuator without the shaft turning) can I expect coming from the allowed technical tolerances of the thread In other words what amount of play can I expect between a threaded bolt and nut To be more specific I realize there will be movement from lateral and longitudinal flexibility of the shaft; from its mounting bearings; from its axial twist against the drive; and probably quite a few other sources but I'd like to know this specific factor - how much of a give or play can there be in a thread allowing movement of the nut along the bolt without either of them turning I suspect that this changes with the shaft diameter so a table or a method to calculate the amount of play for most common metric threads would be preferred for an answer If that's too difficult or doesn't exist I'm most interested in the value for M10 thread,inzinjerstvo,418
414,Electro-mechanical systems typically used in robots have very low delays and are quite simple to build servo controllers for Hydraulic systems are much less common in robotics and have delay due to the length of the hydraulic lines This delay may vary considerably depending on the system conditions What methods exist for dealing with this variable delay when designing a position or velocity servo controllers for hydraulic cylinders,inzinjerstvo,432

420,I'd like to build an exploratory robot that can fit within confined spaces 1 What traction mechanisms should I consider to propel a robot along the inside of a 4 pipe The pipe to be traversed will likely have fluid (assume water) within it to varying degrees from partially full to completely full I'm initially planning on tethering the robot with coaxial cable So far I have considered a 3 and 4 point wheeled approach such as with a Y or X configuration of wheels And I have considered treads instead of wheels The robot will need to be able to navigate 90 o turns on the way in but can be hauled out via the coaxial cable if need be Preferably it will be able to back its way out for the majority of the distance it can cover The robot would not need to climb unassisted The initial use will be in a pipe that drops several feet from the access point and then slopes down approximately 5 feet over a 60 foot run Retrieving the robot will be assisted by the coaxial cable or a tether line 1 It's a rather boring application actually I want to see how badly the roots are creeping into the sewer line from my house,inzinjerstvo,434

433,I'd like to build an exploratory robot that can fit within confined spaces 1 As the robot moves along the inside of a 4 pipe it's likely to encounter some obstacles that need to be removed Typically that will be tree roots up to 1/2 thick There could also be globs of tissue paper caught by the roots The majority of the pipe is made from clay but a small portion of the pipe is cast iron The portion that has the obstacles is clay and was laid in the early 1960's The pipe to be traversed will likely have fluid (assume water) within it to varying degrees from partially full to completely full I'm initially planning on tethering the robot with coaxial cable and possibly an additional line like a steel cable The propulsion mechanism is still being defined but I expect that the robot will have some ability to fix itself in place while clearing out an obstacle The typical way of removing roots and other obstacles is through using a drain cleaning system The cutting head is usually a pronged piece of metal that can burrow through the obstacle The problem with this approach is that the pipe is damaged as part of the cleaning process and some amount of roots are left behind Another commercial approach that completely clears the line utilizes a spinning wire brush The downside of this approach is that pipe wall is severely damaged as part of the cleaning I would like to devise a cutting mechanism that doesn't significantly damage the pipe but also removes the majority of the obstacles encountered What type of cutting shearing grinding etc mechanism should I consider in order to clear out the path in front of the robot as it explores the line 1 It's a rather boring application actually I want to see how badly the roots are creeping into the sewer line from my house Ideally I'd like to clear out the roots too without damaging the clay pipe,inzinjerstvo,1811

2271,For a healthy heart I've got myself into a habit of stopping by the gym after work and using the fitness equipment (treadmill stair machine etc ) or using the stationary bike I have at home However I'll have a vacation in the future where I'll be in a foreign city for a few weeks I won't have access to a gym or fitness equipment I can take a pair of running shoes but I don't think I'd like to run in a foreign city and I'm not much of a runner So aside from running what other kinds of cardio exercise could I do while on vacation say from the comfort of a hotel room I know sit-ups are easy but could those be considered a cardio exercise,fitness,2652
2272,In one book I read the target heart rate for a cardiovascular workout for a person my age (36) was somewhat lower (10-15bpm) than the rate listed on some of the machines I'm familiar with at the gym I've also seen the range differ slightly from one brand of machine to another So I'm slightly confused about this I don't want to overdo it but I also don't want to underdo it Is there definitive information available (e g a study or paper) that details the correct approach to estimating one's target heart rate range,fitness,2291
2277,I've been told when doing cardio to breath in through the nose and out through the mouth Where I live though the air is cold enough 3-4 months of the year so that deep breathing through my nose stings my nasal passages Is this healthy Should I change up my breathing pattern or will the stinging go away,fitness,2341

2290,I've reached a point where my training runs are long enough (2 - 3 hours) and far enough (15+ miles) that I need to take on board some additional energy in the form of gels and/or sports drinks in order to complete them Is there any documented or recognised rate or consumption or guidelines as to how this should ideally be done in order to get the maximum benefits Should they be taken at regular intervals throughout the run or delayed towards the second half of the run I appreciate this will vary depending on effort and fitness; I am currently using a couple of gels and a bottle of sports drink to get me through a 19 5 mile three and a quarter hour run although the last 3 or 4 miles are still a real struggle,fitness,2349
2292,I'll start this Shoulder dislocations - great for improving shoulder mobility,fitness,3302
2293,I have heard a lot about the 'barefoot' running idea that has seemed to gain a lot of popularity with the book Born to Run The main idea is that the human foot has evolved to be very effective at running and by putting a lot of things in between it and the ground we more often cause problems then solve them I don't plan to actually run barefoot but I was thinking of getting some Vibrams since the general idea seemed to make sense to me and they are designed with barefoot running in mind I have seen the flame war arguments about statistics on this so don't bother sharing any of that What I am really looking for is information from people who have tried both running with traditional running shoes and have also tried running with something like Vibrams I want to get an idea about what the difference has been for real people who have actually tried it and who don't have a vested interest in one side of the other,fitness,2386
2297,Being a student I'm not exactly rich I can't currently afford a gym membership or to buy training equipment Luckily my roommate has been kind enough to let me borrow his equipment So far I've been able to get by with the dumbbells and barbells he lent me Recently I realized I have not trained my grip strength in a long long time Unfortunately the only grippers he owns are far too difficult for me Here's the equipment I have at my disposition One weight training bench Several weight disks (2 5 lb 5 lb and 10 lb) Two barbell bars Two dumbbell bars Two 15 lb dumbbells With that gear is there any exercise that I could do to improve my hands' grip strength,fitness,2306

2328,I use creatine and L-glutamine for my workouts typically taking the L-glutamine about an hour before my workout and creatine immediately after (I don't take them together because I understand they compete for receptors limiting absorption) I also try to keep the load up by taking creatine first thing in the morning and L-glutamine last thing before bed regardless of whether I worked out that day My question is do I need to take these supplements on rest days in order to maintain my load Should I be taking two servings* of each on rest days instead of just one Are the daily servings unnecessary *A serving for me is typically a heaping spoonful dissolved in water or cold tea (I know that a sugary drink would help absorption but I'm not willing to take the downside of the sugar),fitness,2370
2329,I regularly workout on my own but on the occasions I workout with a training partner I find my motivation increases my output increases and perhaps most importantly my overall enjoyment increases Jason Ferruggia (a world-renowned S&amp;C coach) has always said that having a good training partner is one of the best things you can do to enhance your rate of progress With this in mind how do you go about finding a training partner if indeed you workout with a partner at all Is it possible to walk into a gym and find people there Is it possible to workout with friends (Especially if you're there to exercise seriously rather than catch up and chat) What experience do you have on finding a training partner,fitness,2331
2334,Whenever jogging for long distances after some time I feel my breathing is quite laboured The only solution is to slow down my pace for a while before proceeding I have checked with my GP and I don't have asthma Are there any exercises or techniques I can use to improve my breathing or lung capacity that will be a benefit while I'm jogging,fitness,2338
2335,The number of push-ups I can do is dismal I have tried over the years to increase the number and have received to pieces of advice Start easy and try something like a raised bar or railing and work your way down or start on your knees until you strengthen your arms Keep persisting even you can initially only do a few you will eventually be able to do more I've tried both approaches but never seem to get anywhere more than around 15 and then collapse in a heap What can I do to increase the number and be able to do more without it being a major struggle as neither of the above methods seems to work,fitness,2350

2409,What weight training exercises can I do with dumbbells that will benefit me most for running 5-10ks Are stomach crunches/sit ups worth doing too,fitness,2438
2416,I always see BMI charts posted in various health related places and I know life insurance companies use it for assessing risk I've heard the normal range of the index is supposedly based on what normal was in 1800s Poland Is this true In any case should a reasonably bulky person using cardio/strength training ever expect to hit that normal range in the normal course of events or might one expect to stay in the 'overweight' category due to new muscle mass,fitness,2417
2418,Each day I drink lots of coffee and energy drinks (redbull 355ml cans) I go to gym 3 times a week (on evenings) Are there any effects on my workouts I stopped drinking any caffeine (at least from coffee and energy drinks) for 3 weeks and didn't feel any changes Not during daytime nor before during or after my workouts My friends often tell me that my heart will explode from such huge amounts of caffeine (I read about caffeine OD and felt caffeine induced disorders symptoms) My question is what's the effect of caffeine on heart/body when person is working out,fitness,2419
2424,My gym got a new back extension machine recently and it is horrible It's designed for someone much smaller than me the angles are all wrong and I find it very difficult to isolate the right muscles (I end up working my legs instead) Is there a way I can target those muscles and do weight training using other equipment available at the gym Edit I had been lifting > 100 pounds with the old back extension machine,fitness,2426
2425,I'm a long distance runner thats not really a fan of all the goo type products I'm curious if there are any natural sources of concentrated sugars with the right balance of electrolytes for long distance running I know that fruits are the most obvious natural sources for these nutrients but which fruits Is there a specific mix of fruits Dried fruits Should salt be added Is the high fiber a concern (don't want to have to go to the bathroom during a race),fitness,2427
2428,While using the freestyle technique of swimming what is the proper way to breathe Is using the nose to breathe out while under better or is there any difference Is there a specific number of 'strokes' that should be done before taking a breath I've been told to alternate your breathing sides and to always make them opposite of the arm raised out of the water is this correct,fitness,2460
2429,There are multiple technique out there with the two I mainly use being breastroke and freestyle Is there a difference between the two as far as their effectiveness in a cardio workout Is there a technique that stands supreme for cardio or is swimming in general just effective,fitness,2453
2430,Recently I have started Yoga but I find myself unable to hold any position more than ten seconds I was told to exaggerate my posture but I simply could not My flexibility is horrific and feel counter productive even when I follow the Yoga books and routines (books and videos) It has been two weeks and I am having hard time improving it Is there a modified way to help me get into the basic positions of Yoga before I can at least be effective in beginner Yoga workout How can I improve,fitness,2443

2436,I go for a 5km before work 2-3 times a week with a longer run at weekends I was doing crunches and other weight based exercises on the off days but have been advised to do it after my runs My question is why is this a better way to do it,fitness,2437
2450,I do several times a week strength and cardio training (Thai boxing to be specific) but also try to mix in extra weight sessions to build up muscle mass Is it good or bad to mix these two I've heard contradictory opinions none backed by evidence Which of the following is more correct Workout every day alternate the type of training (time sink recovery is tricky injuries heal slower) Do both in the same session (is it too much load for one session which one should go first ) You can't have it all it's a tradeoff stick to either one or the other,fitness,2452

2456,Why is it common to rest between sets of repetition Could I instead of resting exercise another muscle group,fitness,2480
2462,Many creatine distributors health forums etc recommend avoiding mixing creatine with citrus juices as supposedly the citric acid could combine with the creatine to produce creatinine which isn't a useful substance for strength training and bodybuilding However it occurs to me that stomach acid is stronger and more acidic than any juice that one is likely to drink So is there something specific about citric acid and creatine that would not apply to stomach acid or is the creatine/citrus warning a myth,fitness,2463
2468,I'm spending most of the day in front of the computer (10+ hours) and as expected my wrist tendons experience strain during work Normally this wouldn't be much of an issue but after I have started training more aggressively (especially with free weights) I feel slight pain and weakness in the wrists when they are at unnatural position under load The frequency of training is not the issue -- usually at most 3 times per week and I do torso/arms exercises only twice per week Now the questions Which arm exercises are known to put less strain on the wrists I'm interested in upper-arm/chest exercises mostly but advice for other muscle groups is appreciated as well Is there something else I can do to reduce the problem (training accessories special exercises other) Edit I'm doing exercise on the weight machines and cables mostly some free weights and stretching No push ups whatsoever,fitness,2482

2485,I'm looking for some exercises that I can do in a swimming pool that will help my muscles to recover after a workout I've seen footballers on TV walking/jogging in the swimming pool the day after a match If you can provide some specific exercises and also timings for when this should be done (e g immediately after the workout or next day etc ) Could doing exercises in a pool actually provide more strain on the muscles if overdone,fitness,2502
2490,Is there a difference between the protein found in red meat (like beef and ostrich) and white meat (like chicken and pork) and protein from fish and should you aim to get these in in any particular ratio to one another Or could protein intake coming mostly from just one of these types be sufficient,fitness,2498
2492,After a hard work out it's generally a good idea to not stop immediately but rather to cool down What is the specific purpose of cooling down Does not properly cooling down affect the actual efficiency of the work out itself,fitness,2497

2494,I know that this may sound silly but I was wondering if there is a proper way to pedal the road bike I've noticed that you can be pedaling more with the front or balls of the feet or by staying flat for the most part or even having the heel of your foot slightly angled down Is there a specific way to pedal that will yield the most efficient use of 'foot power' If so what makes that specific technique more efficient,fitness,2505
2504,Recently I've read some articles that suggest that you should go below 90 degrees On the other hand I've talked with a trainer in my gym and he usually places a bench behind him so that he couldn't go below 90 What is your take Below 90 or 90 Note When I'm talking about degrees I mean the angle your shin bone and femur makes,fitness,2558
4001,It seems to me that the addition of electrons and protons as you move across a period would cause an atom to become larger However I'm told it gets smaller Why is this,hemija,4003
4002,My understanding is that $\mathrm{NaCl}$ is an ionic compound in which $\mathrm{Cl}$ becomes (effectively) $\mathrm{Cl^-}$ and $\mathrm{Na}$ becomes $\mathrm{Na^+}$ So I understand why I would get a sea of particles that would stick together But why does the above mean that it will have a face centered cubic structure with the ions held in place so rigidly,hemija,4056
4004,A reaction proceeds towards the direction of lesser Gibbs Free energy (at constant T and P) So we could say that Gibbs free energy at equilibrium is minimum On the other hand we have $$\Delta G=\Delta G^o + RT\ln Q$$ where $Q$ is the reaction quotient At equilibrium $Q=K_{eq}$ and we already know that $\Delta G^o=-RT\ln K_{eq}$ Substituting we get $\Delta G=0$ at equilibrium But we know that $G$ minimized itself--thus there was a change in $G$ and $\Delta G &lt; 0$ What am I missing here,hemija,4013
4007,When N N-dimethylaniline is reacted with $\ce{H_2SO_4}$ and $\ce{HNO_3}$ it gives mainly the meta product even though $\ce{NMe_2}$ is an ortho / para directing group Why is this,hemija,4012
4011,Recrystallization is a nice way of purifying a product but choosing a suitable solvent if you can't rely on the literature seems like a lot of trial-and-error Are there any general rules on which kind of solvents could be used for recrystallization Which criteria should one use when trying to recrystallize a compound for which no literature on useable conditions exists,hemija,4019
4016,I often hear that water gets purified by being in a silver vessel which sounds plausible because of bactericidal feature of silver What doesn't sound plausible though is the way it's explained that silver releases ions into the water Since silver is a noble metal why would any reaction at all occur with something as neutral as water Is the above explanation nonsense Does the disinfection of water happen only on contact with the metal,hemija,4022
4017,In environmental chemistry most of the organophosphorous compounds we worry about are actually organophosphate compounds Is there something about the $\mathrm{C-P}$ bond that makes it less stable (and thus less persistent in the environment) than a $\mathrm{C-O-P}$ bond,hemija,4090
4018,Organic compounds are typically defined as “molecules containing carbon” Wikipedia states that there for some historical (read non-logical) reasons a few types of carbon-containing compounds such as carbides carbonates simple oxides of carbon and cyanides as well as the allotropes of carbon such as diamond and graphite are considered inorganic I thus wonder is activated charcoal (also known as activated carbon) typically classified as an organic or inorganic material If I follow the list of exceptions given by Wikipedia it should be organic (it's not an allotrope of carbon in particular) but I get the feeling that most people in the field of porous materials would classify it as inorganic So I'm looking for an authoritative reference on this question,hemija,4065
4024,What software is available out there to calculate the equilibrium in a set of reactions in aqueous solution In particular I'm interested in software general enough to simulate things like titration curves involving acido-basicity complex formation precipitation… A web search turns up plenty of academic papers giving algorithms to find the equilibrium of such systems but I'd like to find software that actually performs it In particular it would be really helpful if there existed such software that included a decent database of reaction constants for some well-known reactions (pKa for common acide-base couples complexation and precipitation constants etc ) Edit Apparently I was unclear I'm not looking for molecular simulation codes but for software that can calculate chemical equilibrium in solution from initial concentrations and a database of equilibrium constants for each possible reaction The kind of thing teachers can use to predict titration curve and demonstrate the effect of various initial concentrations to students,hemija,4057
4025,How can one choose which group has more shifting tendency in 1 2 carbocation rearrangement The obvious order is via the stability of the carbocation of the group But phenylic groups have high shifting tendency--and a phenylic carbocation is unstable Is there a way of predicting these I was thinking that it will be related to the delocalization in the triangular intermediate formed Update I'm talking about comparing migratory aptitude of the $R$ groups in a system similar to $&gt;C(+)-C(R_1R_2R_3)$,hemija,4093
4026,The reagent APTES is a fairly common ink for microcontact printing a technique that forms covalent bonds between the silanols found on the surface of the glass and the silane in the the APTES It's also been demonstrated that the mono-layer then polymerizes somewhat forming bonds between neighboring silanols What is the mechanism by which the printing and polymerization occur and what is the reason for using APTES instead of a more reactive trichlorosilane,hemija,4233
4027,I've heard quite a few times that the chromate and permanganate have a $d^3s$ configuration Also their colors arise due to a rapid switching of electrons between the oxygen and metal atoms I don't really understand the 'rapid switching' part--it's obvious why it can give color but I fail to see why there is a need for such a switching-what's so special about $\mathrm{Cr}$ and $\mathrm{Mn}$ (I also do not know what the switching exactly is) An explanation of $d^3s$ would be appreciated though not necessary,hemija,4067
4029,The total synthesis of vitamin B-12 by Robert Burns Woodward and Albert Eschenmoser is over 30 years old At its time it was considered a landmark in the field With current developments (e g olefin metathesis palladium catalysis etc ) is it possible to optimize this synthesis By optimize I mean reduce the number of steps in the synthesis,hemija,4777

4031,In a crystal structure I've determined a triazole ring on my ligand appears to be stacking with a tyrosine (top in picture) However there is also an amide courtesy a glutamine near it (bottom) Is it likely this terminal amide is engaging in &pi;-&pi; interactions with the triazole or just weaker dispersion forces How would I quantify how significant the interaction is,hemija,4038
4033,What conditions promote a nucleophile to undergo the Michael reaction over the nucleophilic attack at the alpha carbon of the carbonyl group in an alpha-beta-unsaturated ketone I'm looking for an answer that considers organic and inorganic nucleophiles (like organocuprates/organolithium compounds),hemija,4051
4045,One synthesis of quinolones begins with the formation of an ethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate as seen in this Organic Syntheses paper I've been asked if the malonate derivative would be formed if methylmalonate was treated with trimethyl orthoformate with a catalytic amount of $\mathrm{H^+}$ without heating The nature of the solvent isn't mentioned but I guess the reaction is carried out in a non-aqueous medium with an ion-exchange resin since I think trimethyl orthoformate acts as a water trap My hunch is that there shouldn't be a significant quantity of product formed We're dealing with an activated methylene why not simply use a base and then carry on with our addition I can't imagine how under normal circumstances the elimination product ethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate will be formed How can this reaction happen in a mechanistically reasonable way,hemija,4362
4046,This question on NaCl crystalization actually got me wondering are there any ionic amorphous solids Like ionic crystals are crystalline materials of electrostatically-attracted ions can ions form an amorphous phase I can see no reason why not but I cannot think of any example either…,hemija,4055
4054,Many of us have experienced the failure of nitrile gloves when exposed to chloroform What's going on at a mechanistic level when this occurs I would guess that the chloroform dissolves some of the polymer into its constituent monomers but I've never heard anything more definite than that Is it a similar mechanism to what happens when chloroform is left too long in a plastic bottle,hemija,4435
4062,In the hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds with hydrogen gas and a catalyst the choice of palladium on carbon is able to hydrogenate alkenes and alkynes but is unable to hydrogenate aromatic compounds Using rhodium or Raney nickel however allows one to hydrogenate aromatics How does the choice of catalyst affect what kind of unsaturated compounds can be hydrogenated,hemija,4104
4063,The most notable characteristic of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE DuPont's Teflon) is that nothing sticks to it This complete inertness is attributed to the fluorine atoms completely shielding the carbon backbone of the polymer If nothing indeed sticks to Teflon how might one coat an object (say a frying pan) with PTFE,hemija,4075
4064,Solvent extraction in a separation funnel is a very common method in preparative organic chemistry But sometimes you don't get a nice phase separation between the organic and the water phase What are the possible causes that can prevent the formation of two distinct phases and how can you force a phase separation when you encounter such situations,hemija,4066
4069,I'm currently taking VCE (Victorian Certificate of Education) Chemistry classes and we're currently studying the interpretation of spectra produced by Hydrogen NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy When studying the spectra of High Resolution 1 H NMR the peaks representing the different Hydrogen environments are split into multiplets based on the protons surrounding these environments There has been a considerable amount of confusion in my classes over the actual principles / rules of thumb on how to calculate the multiplets for a particular environment of a known chemical (i e ; known structue) based off the 'n + 1' rule (i e ; an environment with n neighbours will be split into n+1 multiplets) We are absolute on the principles that; Peaks of a particular Hydrogen environment are not split by neighbouring protons in equivalent environments OH does not and is not split by it's neighbouring environments However immense confusion arised over whether the following principle was correct Peaks of a particular Hydrogen environment will only be split by the protons in neighbouring environments once for each type of neighbouring environment e g The middle CH 2 environment in CH 3 –CH 2 –CH 3 will only have 4 peaks; Although it has 6 neighbouring protons they are two lots of the same environment (CH 3 ) As a class we found numerous examples from different text books and sources that provide examples of ¹H NMR spectra which did not clarify the matter; Some considered all neighbouring protons as neighbours others discriminated on the repeated neighbouring environments For example the CH 2 in CH 3 –CH 2 –CH 3 was sometimes split into 4 peaks or 7 peaks depending on the source Many Chemistry teachers contradicted each other on the matter There was repeated self corrections made by the teachers such that now nobody really knows whether this principle is correct or not So is there anybody that has the correct information on the matter Is there a reasonable explanation behind this strange lack of correlation or is there a common misconception about multiplet splitting Ultimately; How many multiplets should the CH 2 in CH 3 –CH 2 –CH 3 have (Note that if there is a complicated explanation that I am currently only at Year 12 VCE level so links to resources I can pursue would be extremely helpful It's been established that VCAA (an authority for the education system in Australia) ensures that the chemicals featured in the exams for NMR analysis will not be of a structure so as to allow the ambiguity above ),hemija,4078
4071,I am curious about the timescales of protonation and deprotonation of solvent systems As a followup how is this affected when the proton source is separated by an organic phase For instance it is known that the pH inside a liposome can be maintained from the outside What are the timescales of protonation when the protons need to be transported across various micelles thickness,hemija,21319
4072,Our work is faced with the issue of determining the charge of compounds that are dissolved in chloroform One could realistically determine the charge of the relevant moieties knowing the pKa of those groups However how would you determine or calculate the pH of an organic solvent An alternative way of asking this question is how would one calculate the concentration of hydronium ions or free protons in a nonaqueous solution,hemija,4318
4076,The Hofmeister Series is a useful metric in understanding how to precipate proteins However wikipedia and many other source indicate that the order of the series is rather empirical I'm curious about the variety of explanations of the mechanism of the series as well as the application of the series to other non-protein macromolecules,hemija,4077
4079,All arenes when treated with hot conc acidic $\rm KMnO_4$ are oxidised to benzoic/pthallic/etc acids I've tried to examine how this happens using the mechanism of oxidation of double bonds via cyclic intermediate as a reference but I can't manage to cook up a satisfactory one In an older book I have read that there is no (known) mechanism for many organic oxidation reactions I'm inclined to think that this may have changed So is there a mechanism for this If so what is it If not what are the hurdles in finding this mechanism (eg why don't other proposed mechanisms if they exist work ),hemija,4086
4087,I have a solution of copper acetate and I would like to play around with the ligands to get different colors Background The copper acetate was made through mixing vinegar (5% acetic acid) NaCl and C$_{\textrm{(s)}}$ The deep blue-colored copper acetate spontaneously formed during a month in my dark storage room [edit] I neglected to mention that the experiment simultaneously produced a 0 5 inch deposit of what appears to be Copper Carbonate or Verdigris on the bottom of the 1 Liter beaker Also I have let the copper acetate solution evaporate for several years now The former 1L is now 1/2 liter and has begun precipitating crystals (like the ones on the wiki page) Fun fact During the Renaissance glacial acetic acid was made by dry distilling metal acetates and primarily copper(II) acetate [/edit] Question(s) What easily obtained household chemicals may be mixed with samples of the copper acetate to change the ligands attached to the copper and thereby alter the color Will heating or cooling the solution change the color and/or ligands,hemija,4101
4088,One frequent argument against the safety of the synthetic sweetener aspartame is that it can be hydrolyzed with one of the hydrolysis products being methanol which is known to be toxic Of course usually not much aspartame is added in food anyway to yield a sufficient amount of methanol or its oxidation product formaldehyde but this does beg the question why wasn't say the ethyl ester chosen to be developed as an artificial sweetener Is there a structure-activity relationship between the alcohol used to esterify the dipeptide and the sweetness of the product,hemija,4173
4089,The nucleobases in DNA and RNA are generally present in the keto-form and not in the enol-form As an interesting historical note James Watson and Francis Crick did initially believe them to adopt the enol-form which isn't compatible with the correct model of the DNA they later proposed But there are some reports indicating that in certain RNA structures guanosine and uridine form essentially a Watson-Crick basepair where one of the two bases is present in the enol-form instead of the usual G-U wobble base pair Is there anything known on how large the energy difference between the keto- and the enol-form of those bases actually is,hemija,4095
4091,I am working on metal and its ion The problem is I would like to know whether the metal has been converted to its ionic form or not The hypothesis for the analysis is Metals are good conductors and ions possess redox potential Therefore by measuring the conductance and red-ox potential is it possible to differentiate whether I have metal or metal ion The question is Based on the hypothesis can I expect a positive result Apart from this is there any other technique where I can qualitatively / quantitatively measure metal and its ion,hemija,4097
4092,Whilst we are taught to represent benzene as below (A) due to its delocalised electrons however when two benzene rings share carbons (e g naphtalene) it seems to be more commonly represented in textbooks as two conjugated rings (B) Whilst I realise that the result is the same what is the advantage gained by drawing them like this rather than (C) Is it simply a matter of clarity A B C Whilst draing those in Marvin I wondered if it was as the delocalisation between the shared carbons isn't shown I e it looks like the electrons are delocalised across both rings separately rather than as one big ring,hemija,4098
4105,It is known that although only the (S) -enantiomer of the infamous sedative thalidomide possesses teratogenic properties it is not very useful to administer the pure (R) -enantiomer since it is racemized within the body Are there other known examples of drugs that are stereoconverted in vivo How does the body perform the conversion,hemija,4106
4141,I'm looking at the melting temperature of metallic elements and notice that the metals with high melting temperature are all grouped in some lower-left corner of the $d$ block If I take for example the periodic table with physical state indicated at 2 165 K I see that (apart from boron and carbon) the only elements still solid at that temperature form a rather well-defined block aroung tungsten (which melts at 3 695 K) So what makes this group of metals melt at such high temperature,hemija,4338
4142,Many diagrams of orbitals I've seen involve electrons moving through a center point—where the nucleus is How can this be Clearly they don't actually pass through the nucleus so what does happen,hemija,4186
4148,Both Vanadium and its 3+ ion are paramagnetic Use electron configuration to explain why this is so The electron configuration of Vanadium is [Ar] 4s 2  3d 3 If drawn in a box diagram it would be shown that the electron in the $d$ orbitals aren't paired This explains how an uncharged Vanadium is paramagnetic but if Vandium loses 3 electrons the only shells left are ones with paired electrons How can a Vanadium 3+ ion be paramagnetic if it loses all its unpaired electrons,hemija,4150
4151,When I look around for why copper and chromium only have one electron in their outermost s orbital and 5/10 in their outermost d orbital I'm bombarded with the fact that they are more stable with a half or completely filled d orbital so the final electron enters that orbital instead of the 'usual' s orbital What I'm really looking for is why the d orbital is more stable this way I assume it has to do with distributing the negative charge of the electrons as evenly as possible around the nucleus since each subshell of the d orbital is in a slightly different location leading to a more positive charge in the last empty or half-filled d orbital Putting the final electron in the s orbital would create a more negative charge around the atom as a whole but still leave that positive spot empty Why does this not happen with the other columns as well Does this extra stability work with all half or completely filled orbitals except columns 6 and 11 are the only cases where the difference is strong enough to 'pull' an electron from the s orbital It seems like flourine would have a tendency to do do this as well so I suppose the positive gap left in the unfilled p orbital isn't strong enough to remove an electron from the lower 2s orbital,hemija,4160
4152,My chemistry book explains that even though electrons in the 2p orbital are closer to the nucleus on average electrons from the 2s orbital spend a very short time very close to the nucleus (penetration) so it has a lower energy Why does this tiny amount of time spent close to the nucleus make such a big difference It seems like it should be the average distance that matters not the smallest distance achieved at any one point in determining stability What makes that momentary drop in energy so important that it is outweighs all the time spent farther away from the nucleus with a higher energy,hemija,4376
4153,There are some stereochemical reactions that result in the presence of enantiomers When moving forward with a practical organic synthesis how does one usually separate them in order to continue with one of the enantiomers,hemija,4155
4158,The most stable cyclohexane form is the chair conformation but on the other hand the bigger the side-chain of the cyclohexane is its hydrogen atoms become more equatorial rather than axial which brings them closer to the cyclohexane's hydrogens Shouldn't they arrange in a less energetic but a more stable conformation,hemija,4322
4162,Phosphate buffer is a common buffer in biological applications it's especially popular for NMR Magnesium ions are necessary for many biological systems to work though the amount of magnesium ions you can add in a phosphate buffer is limited by the relatively low solubility of magnesium phosphate What I'm curious about is whether the phosphate buffer can affect the availability of magnesium ions even in concentrations where no visible precipitation occurs Common phosphate buffer concentrations are around 10-100 mM and magnesium ions are usually 5 mM or below At those concentrations I see no visible precipitation but is the magnesium actually fully available or is the phosphate sequestering it and thereby lowering the effective magnesium ion concentration in the solution Even just calculating the solubility of magnesium salts in phosphate buffer is not straightforward as there are multiple species of magnesium phosphate and possibly even other salts like $\ce{MgKPO4}$ Does phosphate buffer affect the availability of magnesium ions in solution compared to a non-interacting buffer If that is so is there a way to calculate the size of that effect,hemija,8681
4163,I was tasked with figuring out whether Carbon or Nitrogen has a more negative electron affinity value I initially picked Nitrogen just because Nitrogen has a higher Z$_{eff}$ creating a larger attraction between electrons and protons decreasing the radius causing a higher Ionization Energy and therefore decreasing the electron affinity value but I was actually wrong and the solutions manual explains it as this As you trace from C to N across the periodic table you would normally expect N to have the more negative electron affinity However N has a half-filled p sublevel which lends it extra stability therefore it is harder to add an electron Are there any major exception rules when comparing electron affinity I'm hesitant to use Nitrogen as an exception because I don't know how far it extends If Nitrogen has a more positive EA than Carbon does that also extend to Boron or Aluminium or Phosphorus I later found that this also applies when comparing Silicone and Phosphorus The explanation was the same What exception rules should be noted when comparing electron affinity Are there any at all And how far does the exception with atoms with half-filled p sublevels extend Note I'm not entirely sure which tags fit this question so I encourage anyone who knows to edit it in,hemija,4166
4164,Most periodic tables only feature one Hydrogen atom on the top of the first group But some like the one I was given also show Hydrogen in the 7th group to left of Helium Why are there two Hydrogen atoms What's the difference between the two and why do we work with the left one more often than the right,hemija,4165
4168,Overall ring strain seems to be a big issue when it comes to organic chemistry That is why cyclopentane may be in an envelope form or why cyclobutane may be in a kinked kite form Both of these example molecules are not planar So why is epoxide (oxacyclopropane) a stable molecule if at all,hemija,4171
4172,According to wikipedia and the references given therein $\pi\cdots\pi$ stacking interactions are the result of interaction between the quadrupole moments of two aromatic rings rationalising the stabilisation of perpendicular and offset-parallel association modes of the benzene dimer Conventional wisdom is that the supramolecular complexes of buckminsterfullerene and functionalised corannulenes (the so-called buckycatchers) are stabilised by $\pi\cdots\pi$ stacking How can the quadrupole interaction explanation be reconciled with the pseudo-spherical symmetry of buckminsterfullerene Surely the interaction must be entirely Van der Waals in nature,hemija,4183
4174,Since the steam pressure of ammonia is higher than that of water I would expect distillation to be a reasonable way of seperating a mixture of both However in industrial applications known to me there's always a step of stripping the ammonia chemically from the vapor Why is this necessary,hemija,4451
4180,For example why does for example oxygen turn into gas at a much lower temperature than water Does it have anything to do with the molecular structure A water molecule does have a more complex structure than oxygen though the R-410A (a mixture of two gases commonly used in heating pumps) is much more complex than water and it boils at -48 5 degrees Celsius,hemija,4181
4187,If dry ammonia gas is passed through anhydrous copper sulfate will it turn blue (due to the formation of tetraamminecopper(II) complex) Or will silver chloride form diamminesilver(I) complex in liquid ammonia If the above complexes do not get formed in non-aqueous mediums why is it so,hemija,4188
4189,Over the course of my studies I have switched largely from using Z-matrix representations of molecular geometries in calculations to Cartesian representations The software that I use now makes it easy to add the sorts of constraints/restraints/transits that I would have previously used Z-matrices for and I know that Z-matrix geometries can be problematic in large molecules * where minute changes in a bond angle or dihedral (due for instance to rounding errors/low-quality gradients) can result in large movements in peripheral atoms What pros or cons exist for either geometry definition that I don't know about What circumstances recommend one representation over another *Or small molecules with silly Z-matrices,hemija,4192
4191,Pennsylvania State University provides irradiated $\ce{NaCl}$ (180 000 rads of gamma radiation) to teachers for a very entertaining demonstration The salt is orange after irradiation When it is placed on a hot plate you see a flash of visible light and the salt returns to it normal color The explanation provided with the salt is that The heat allows the electrons that were trapped in the crystal structure (when the energy was deposited) to return to their original position This language evokes a picture of a particle electron in a crystal jail for me The explanation goes on to say that the energy is released as a photon of visible light (I understand this part of the explanation ) So my question is how are electrons trapped in a crystal structure What keeps them in an excited state,hemija,4193
4194,To my understanding cationic polymerization is a type of living polymerization but my teacher's notes and Wikipedia seem to suggest they're different I can't see the difference The same goes for anionic polymerization From what I've studied so far the difference must be subtle if there is one Is there such a difference,hemija,4524
4215,I've always seen benzyne (benzene with a triple bond) classified as an intermediate I really don't see why it needs to be an intermediate though The possible reasons I can come up with are flimsy It has an unstable sp 2 – sp 2 $\pi$ bent bond we have bent bonds with more angle strain in cyclopropane which is not an intermediate Though those bonds are $\sigma$ bonds It immediately reacts with itself to form a dimer biphenylene in the absence of other reagents there are many other molecules which spontaneously dimerize (eg $\ce{NO2}$ at certain temperatures) yet they are not classified as intermediates So what makes benzyne an intermediate More generally (but possibly too broad) what makes a molecule an intermediate,hemija,4218
4216,You can buy NMR tubes in a huge variety of qualities with an equally huge difference in price between the cheapest and the most expensive NMR tubes They are usually rated for a specific spectrometer frequency e g 300 MHz+ or 600 MHz+ What is the difference between these different grades of NMR tubes And how large is the effect on the quality of the spectra if a lower-grade tube is used,hemija,4219
4217,There are two kinds of bonds between polymers in solid material primary and secondary Primary bonds can be also called cross-linked bonds What is the difference between the two (strength type response to stress/strain etc) How do they compare to bonds inside a polymer,hemija,4227
4220,Given an organic compound is there any way to decide if it is volatile (or compare volatility--everything is volatile in the end) Volatility is due to the tendency to evaporate The conclusion I can draw from this is that a more volatile compound will be lighter and/or will have less intermolecular forces But this doesn't seem to work--I recall that methanol is less volatile than ethanol ([citation needed]) So are there any general guidelines for this or is it another experimental property,hemija,4223
4222,The main chemistry prep room at my institution (and also at the ambulance station) is labelled with the standard green compressed gas sign However there is a small '2' included within the diamond None of the chemistry technicians tutors or ambulance staff seem to know what it is referring to and I can't find any reference of it on the internet Would anyone here happen to know The related products of this online provider show that other hazards have different numbers but some also have two (e g flammable) Is there a standard that is being referred to here,hemija,4224
4228,Diborane has the interesting property of having two 3-centered bonds that are each held together by only 2 electrons (see the diagram below from Wikipedia ) These are known as banana bonds I'm assuming there is some sort of bond hybridization transpiring but the geometry doesn't seem like it is similar to anything I'm familiar with Carbon doing What sort of hybridization is it and why don't we see many (any ) other molecules with this bond structure,hemija,4229
4230,If you characterize the chemical bonds to two categories physical and chemical bonds how do you do it Aren't all bonds chemical and physical From the freedictionary com chemical bond Any of several forces especially the ionic bond covalent bond and metallic bond by which atoms or ions are bound in a molecule or crystal What is the physical bond then How should the atom be bonded to molecule if these bonds are not the ones What are these several forces excactly In the answer I would like to see the lists of chemical and physical bonds,hemija,4234
4235,Neil Bartlett (1932–2008) first synthesized $\ce{XeF{_4}}$ (and $\ce{XeF{_6}}$) in 1962 In the synthesis a nickel chamber is used and heated to 400&deg;C causing the formation of $\ce{NiF{_4}}$ which Wikipedia claims is not part of the reaction Due to the nature of the noble gas xenon one might imagine that the fluorines would need to could be forced onto the $\ce{Xe}$ atom at the same time otherwise with each addition the molecule would be even less energetically likely I was trying to ascertain in what geometric form the four fluorine atoms would configure themselves to make this addition possible I had first assumed that the nickel was being used as a catalyst and the fluorines could be plucked from its surface accordingly but this does not jive with the description of the synthesis above According to the response below one synthesis of the molecule does rely on forming fluoride radicals on a catalyst but it's mysterious that the synthesis above does not mention this Assuming there is no catalyst how are the fluorines at 400&deg;C oriented to allow the addition of 2 molecules at presumably the same time F - F F - F (and is that even possible ),hemija,4237
4236,I've known that hybridization in distorted geometries is not exactly $sp^3$ or $sp^2$ or whatever For example $\ce{PH3}$ has nearly pure $p$ orbitals in the $\ce{P-H}$ bond and the lone pair is in a nearly pure $s$ orbital Basically since hybridisation is an addition of wavefunctions instead of a perfect symmetrical addition of the kets we get something else While answering this question I realised that it's not that easy predicting the numbers Take the same image of $\ce{B2H6}$ At first seeing the 97&deg; I thought well the inner $\ce{B-H}$ bonds will be almost pure $p$ But with that I couldn't figure out where the 120&deg; came from because that is for perfect $sp^2$ I then realised that I was being stupid and it wasn't that simple--just because you have a 120&deg; doesn't mean pure $sp^2$ But I was at a loss trying to find out approximate hybridizations for $\ce{B2H6}$ How does one generally go about predicting such nonuniform hybridizations if one knows the bond angles Approximations are OK--I believe the exact mixture ratios will require some knowledge of the exact wavefunctions,hemija,4339
4238,I've always thought that orbitals lead to a loss of symmetry and have never been able to give myself a satisfactory answer to this I'll explain via an example Let's take an $\ce{N^3+}$ atom It's perfectly spherical and has no distinguishing 'up' and 'down' There is no set of 'preferred coordinate axes' for it since it has spherical symmetry (except the nucleus but I doubt that matters) Now let's give it three electrons They arrange themselves in the $2p$ orbitals one in each (by Hund's rule) Now suddenly the atom has lost its spherical symmetry — we have a distinct triplet of orthogonal directions separate from the others This leads to these questions How can symmetry 'break' this way Are the directions of the axes 'hidden' in the atom beforehand Are they themselves wavefunctions (though a wavefunction of wavefunctions sound odd to me this explanation makes sense-random events can break symmetries) So I'd like a clear explanation of how/why the symmetry breaks,hemija,4334
4240,Let's say I synthesized or isolated a chiral molecule and want to know the absolute configuration (R or S) of that molecule I could obviously solve the structury by X-Ray crystallography but that's a lot of work and I might not want to do that or might not have access to the necessary equipment What other ways exist to determine the absolute configuration of a molecule experimentally,hemija,4241

4249,Besides elucidating or verifying a chemical structure NMR can also be used e g for quantifying a mixture of different chemicals Depending on the quality of the spectrum and the specific substance integrating the NMR signals for the same molecule can result in significant variations from the actual ratio of nuclei which is known from the chemical structure What factors do affect the quantification of NMR signals in a proton 1D spectrum What precautions should one take during acquisition and processing of NMR spectra to make sure that the spectra can be analyzed quantitatively,hemija,4371
4250,I once had an Orgo TA refer to a diazo compound as diazo-boom-boom (the technical term) I have always been curious as to the reason behind the instability and reactivity According to wikipedia Some of the most stable diazo compounds are ?-diazoketones and ?-diazoesters since the negative charge is delocalized into the carbonyl In contrast most alkyldiazo compounds are explosive What is it about the alkyldiazos that makes them so much more unstable There doesn't appear to be any bond strain or other factors Naively I can say that having a resonance structure should make it marginally more stable,hemija,4251

4263,I have come across many reactions that are zero order reactions but at one glance I'm unable to tell if they are zero order or not Is there any criteria that can be used to identify these reactions or are they purely experimentally determined,hemija,4265
4264,One of the drugs I work with is a beta-lactam (4-membered ring with an amide bond) fused to a sulfone ring tazobactam It's relatively stable in water; the lactam is not significantly hydrolyzed without being catalyzed When the lactam is hydrolyzed however typically by an enzyme and the lactam ring opened the sulfone ring also opens cleaving the bond between the sulfur and bridgehead carbon A paper by Kuzin gives the following reaction scheme (this is part of figure 2 click for the whole thing) and says of it (emphasis mine) The Ser70-bound moiety (2) is thought to be the initial intermediate [ ] Ring opening after departure of the sulfinate from C5 produces a reactive imine (3) and the more inert tautomeric enamine forms (4 5) But why is the sulfuryl (sulfone sulfonyl( ) ) leaving only when the lactam is opened and not spontaneously beforehand Other fused bicyclic beta-lactam drugs don't open the other ring where in lieu of the sulfone there is commonly a thioether (as in penicillin) The sulfone group seems more electron hungry but I don't see how the broken lactam bond affects this I've heard some people suggest that the lone pair on the nitrogen is able to make this happen but why doesn't it then happen in the intact drug,hemija,4268
4267,Oscillating reactions are a funny aspect of chemistry I have tried to find various simplified kinetic models of oscillating reactions such as the Belouzov-Zhabotinsky the Briggs–Rauscher or the Bray–Liebhafsky reactions in order to be able to study them However the models I have found so far are either too complicated (8 or more species considered) or loose chemical significance For an example of the second case Ball's 1994 model [1] corresponds to While this is useful and introduces a nice circularity in the model creating the possible feedback it has lost all chemical sense — by which I mean that no correspondance can be established between the species of this model and a real oscillating system So my question is what's the simplest known chemically-meaningful model of an oscillating reaction [1] Ball P 1994 Designing the molecular world Chemistry at the frontier Princeton NJ Princeton University Press,hemija,4274

4275,Historically thiols $\ce{-SH}$ were known as mercapto- due to their strong propensity to bond with mercury Certain drugs still carry this designation though mercaptopurine has an $\ce{=S}$ group instead of a thiol What makes the thiol group bond so strongly with mercury in particular Why don't alcohols make such a strong bond with $\cf{Hg}$ If it's known was there any historical reason why it was important to be able to capture mercury,hemija,4277
4276,In a thesis I am reading it is said that one of the reasons for using plane-wave basis sets for first-principles molecular dynamics (aka ab initio MD) is that the Pulay forces [1 2] that arise from an MD using atomic basis sets are computationally expensive to calculate While I understand that having additional terms means more code to write i e they make writing the software harder to write is it true that they are CPU-intensive to compute The criterion I would use to quantify this subjective statement is Given that you have already calculated the energy and forces at that point you have already computed a large number of integrals required for this task and involving basis functions overlap integrals terms of the form $\left\langle\phi_\alpha\left|\hat{A}\right|\phi_\beta\right\rangle$ where operator $\hat{A}$ is either the hamltonian its gradient or any other operator necessary for the calculation of energy or forces Would the calculation of Pulay forces require any more integrals to be evaluated or can it be straightforwardly computed from those previously-calculated integrals alone [1] P Pulay Molec Phys 19 197 (1969) [2] See also slide 6 of this,hemija,4337
4278,Related (very similar but here I want a mechanism) http //physics stackexchange com/q/21827/7433 By the Kohlrausch law all ions contribute to the conductivity of an electrolyte Now as I understand it the mechanism of conduction in an electrolyte is thus Ions migrate in solution These ions get reduced or oxidized at the electrodes and converted to electrons These electrons continue down the wire leading to an increased/maintained conductivity/current But this mechanism doesn't work for ions which do not get redoxed--movement of ions in the solution cannot be translated to movement of electrons in the wire and thus it seems (to me) that conductivity should not increase But ions like $\ce{NO3-}$ have a comparable $\lambda$ (ionic molar conductivity)--so they experimentally do increase conductivity What is the mechanism for conduction via these ions,hemija,4291

4285,My understanding is that the NBO methodology transforms the molecular orbital picture of a molecule into a collection of pairwise interactions (bond orbitals) This is obviously handy for didactic and comprehension purposes as it distils what might be a very complex and non-local MO picture into manageable lobes conforming to the introductory theories of chemical bonding (VB orbital hybridisation) taught in high-school and early university courses Does natural bond orbital theory have utility outside of this role,hemija,4292
4286,When I was reading through the ADF-BAND tutorials one of the toy systems presented was a 1-D periodic structure involving 3 collinear hydrogen atoms The tutorial pointed out that topologically speaking this is cylindrically symmetrical (more specifically it's ring symmetrical) In the instance of a 2-D structure can the calculation be considered a model for the surface of a torus (this seems logical) a sphere (I doubt this because if you fit a rectilinear grid to a sphere you end up with two poles and dissimilar meridians and parallels) or other Bonus questions Has anyone used periodic calculations to model electronic structure/chemistry on the surface of a sphere or torus Can you introduce a curvature term to account for these structures having a finite size,hemija,4287
4289,Can derive the quantity of a substance from a GC/MS report if I know the ratio to another substance in the data the quantity of that second substance and the molecular mass of both substances The site was very dense and vague regarding how GC/MS test work but fairly upfront regarding how they derive their ratios Here are the numbers (slightly tweaked but more or less in proportion) Substance A Quantity $300&#160;\ \mathrm{mg}$ (Know already not part of GC/MS report) Mol Mass $500&#160;\ \mathrm{g/mol}$ (found in external source) Peak Proportion 3 Substance X Quantity Unknown Mol Mass $425&#160;\ \mathrm{g/mol}$ (again external source) Peak Proportion 1 To be clear the ratio of 1 3 means that substance X has a horizontal peak $\frac13$ of substance A I'm not clear on what the x-axis is actually a measurement of which is part of why I'm at a loss The site does make it very explicit that the ratios are not directly proportional to mass ratio (so if it found a ratio of 3 1 of glucose to arsenic this doesn't mean the substance is 75% glucose and 25% arsenic only that the glucose peaks 3 times higher which I've taken to mean 3 times the oomph but that may be incorrect as well) So if I know that the molecular mass($M$) of substance X is 0 85 of substance Y can I derive the actual mass of substance X using the formula \begin{equation}\mathrm{qty}_X=\frac{\mathrm{qty}_A\times(M_X/M_A)}{\mathrm{peak}_A/\mathrm{peak}_X}\end{equation} with data being \begin{equation}qty_X=\frac{300\ \mathrm{mg}\times(425/500)}{3/1}\end{equation} Which simplifies to \begin{equation}qty_X=(300\text{ mg}\times 0 85)/3\end{equation} and finally the result of $85&#160;\ \mathrm{mg}$ So I guess in the end there are 3 questions Is this even how GC/MS results work If so is my assumption to derive the mystery quantity using the molecular mass correct Is the math itself in order (I'm specifically worried that I should invert either the mass ratio or the peak ratio or both) Of course if the answer to the first questions is no then my true question is can I derive the quantity of substance X with the given data and if so what would be the right approach If anyone is curious for some context I need to know the actual quantity of substance X as I know that by mass it has a threshold between harmless and toxic so just knowing substance X is $\frac13$ peak of substance A doesn't let me know if I should let my dog/child/self ingest it,hemija,4323
4290,Is there a formal definition or algorithm that can take a list of reactions and tell me whether it contains a set of species that can produce itself autocatalytically It is clear that the following reaction is autocatalytic $$\ce{ A + B \to 2 B }$$ B appears on both sides of the equation so it's a catalysis reaction and there is an extra B produced on the right so it catalyses its own production from A But the following reaction scheme can also be considered to contain autocatalysis $$ \ce{B + C \to D + E\\ A + D \to 2C} $$ If this system starts out with plenty of A and B together with one molecule of C then the C molecule can react with a B to produce a D which can then react with an A to produce two C's — whereas without the initial seed molecule no reactions will take place (I'm neglecting reverse reactions here of course but hopefully it gets the point across ) The autocataltic cycle can easily be seen in the following diagram where circles represent species and boxes represent reactions Another non-obvious example of autocatalysis is a reaction scheme of this form $$\ce{ A + C \to C + D\\ B + D \to D + C + E} $$ Here C and D each catalyse the production of one another from the precursors A and B I'm aware of Kauffman's definition of reflexively autocatalytic sets which applies to schemes of this form but would miss an autocatalytic cycle of the kind shown above since it doesn't consist of single-step catalysis reactions So I'm looking for a definition of autocatalysis that would include both cases as well as (hopefully) other more complex schemes that I haven't yet thought of,hemija,4805
4293,Looking at something like $\cf{ YBa{_2}Cu{_3}O{_7}}$ which was one of the first cuprate superconductors to be discovered I'm always curious how the selection of these substances as likely superconductors comes about Does it have to do with optimal crystalline structure unpaired electrons or is it similar to the way semiconductors are designed with doping to create holes Or are these superconductors simply determined experimentally based on small changes of what has worked in the past As a side question I've always been curious as to how they stumbled upon Yttrium for this particular case It's not something I think of as being carried in ready supply Would this have been after YAG lasers were already around,hemija,4352

4297,Solvated electrons have a long lifetime in ammonia solutions but their counterparts in water (called hydrated electrons) have a much smaller lifetime of the order of microseconds in very pure water (image from Boero et al Phys Rev Lett 2003 90 226403) What properties of the solvent account for these very different lifetimes Both are polar protic solvents so what other(s) factor(s) could be involved here,hemija,4305
4298,I've always been a bit uncomfortable with the concept of more than two electrons in a single orbital-like region(probability-wise) which occurs in resonance This seems to disobey Pauli's exclusion principle Let's take benzene for example It has a delocalized cloud of electrons These all had the original (as in if resonance didn't occur) quantum numbers $n=2 l=1 m=\text{(1 0 or -1; but it must be the same for all)} m_s=\pm\frac12$ But due to delocalization they're now all in one extra-large orbital-like region (by orbital-like I mean that the pi cloud is similar to an orbital in the sense that it is also a probability cloud which defines the probabilities of finding one or more electrons at different coordinates) Now it's obvious that the original quantum numbers are insufficient here due to Pauli's exclusion principle They may not even exist for these electrons The easiest thing to do would be to propose (not exactly propose since I guess the Dirac equation can prove their existence) an extra quantum number which can take twelve values Or a combination of a few extra quantum numbers that have the same effect But this raises the question do the electrons belonging to the pi cloud retain their original quantum numbers as well Basically I want to know how benzene and other resonating compounds are described quantum mechanically with focus on quantum numbers (links to papers are fine probably necessary here--but please explain the gist of the link) I'd prefer the answer in terms of simpler quantum mechanics though I'm not averse to the idea of some extra reading,hemija,4302
4299,In many places I've seen the extra bond in benzyne being labelled as $sp^2-sp^2$ overlap or distorted (not parallel) $p\pi-p\pi$ overlap But I've failed to see why we can't have a normal parallel $p\pi-p\pi$ overlap Wikipedia says In benzyne however the p orbitals are distorted to accommodate the triple bond within the ring system reducing their effective overlap That makes no sense to me — why can't a normal parallel $p\pi-p\pi$ overlap be accomodated within the system So what is the reason for the distorted $\pi$ bond in benzyne I'm fine with answers involving a bit of QM/MO theory,hemija,4301
4300,From here I can see why hapticity changes here but not why it is necessary for the benzene ring to bend The resonance energy of benzene is pretty large and there's no balancing increase in stability elsewhere--unless the decrease of hapticity increases stability which I doubt (more delocalization=more stability not vice versa) Also the concept of a bent benzene is a bit strange to me I'd like to know what exactly is going on in this reaction and why it happens @F'x mentioned that the bent benzene may just be a way of drawing the molecule to clearly show the change of overlap If this is the case I'd still like to know how the hapticity changed (because my initial logic behind change of hapticity is invalid if the structure doesn't actually bend),hemija,4311
4306,In “periodic table” the adjective is related to the noun period and comes from Ancient Greek ???????? through French périodique In “periodic acid” it is formed from the prefix per- and iodic (like peroxide and permanganate ) Wiktionary lists their respective UK pronunciations of as /p??(?) i??d?k/ and /?p??ra???d?k/ markedly different p??

4314,I have been reading about resolution in Mass Spectrometry and there are a few things I do not understand The resolving power is determined by m/(m2-m1) at full width half height of a peak The higher the value obtained the better This is where I struggle to form a link between the resolution of the Mass spectrometer and the resolving power In image A below the resolution of the Mass Spectrometer is 1000 and would have a very low mass resolution value but in image B the resolution is 5000 and the nominal peaks masses are separated therefore providing a high mass resolution value Why can a mass spectrometer with a resolution of 5000 resolve the nominal masses and the mass spectrometer with a resolution of 1000 cannot and how does the mass resolution come into play Also what do the values of 1000 and 5000 mean,hemija,4315
4316,In Density Functional Theory courses one is often reminded that Kohn-Sham orbitals are often said to bear no any physical meaning They only represent a noninteracting reference system which has the same electron density as the real interacting system That being said there are plenty of studies in that field’s literature that given KS orbitals a physical interpretation often after a disclaimer similar to what I said above To give only two examples KS orbitals of H 2 O [1] and CO 2 closely resemble the well-known molecular orbitals Thus I wonder what good (by virtue of being intuitive striking or famous) examples can one give as a warning of intepreting the KS orbitals resulting from a DFT calculation [1] “What Do the Kohn-Sham Orbitals and Eigenvalues Mean ” R Stowasser and R Hoffmann J Am Chem Soc 1999 121 3414–3420,hemija,4336

4324,Many computational chemistry packages permit the calculation of vibrational and electronic spectra These spectra are obtained as a set of discrete eigenvalues however they are often convolved with some distribution to give a continuous spectrum that is realistic for a finite temperature rather than a sequence of impulse functions The ADF package allows the user to convolve the spectrum with either a Gaussian or Cauchy (Lorentzian) function My understanding is that the latter affords a more realistic line broadening however the Gaussian must be there for a reason Which spectral broadening scheme is preferred Why the choice,hemija,4325
4326,The identification of point groups of a molecule is usually done following a strict scheme either manually or algorithmically In all textbooks I could find however the first step of the scheme is actually not explicited in this example scheme drawn from Housecroft and Sharpe you can see that there is a very unhelpful step “Does this molecule have $I_h$ $O_h$ or $T_d$ symmetry ” It is implied that one would recognize e g an icosahedral molecular compound on sight However I wonder how can one strictly identify these “special” point groups What set of rules is to be followed (again either manually or algorithmically),hemija,4327

4340,We have a well that delivers hard water and we do not have a water softener (There was a “green sand filter” that utilizes permanganate to oxidize other metals on the system but it has been disconnected ) Analysis of the well water shows the presence of iron in noticeable amounts No other metal ions were specifically identified The system does have an ozonator to oxidize Fe (II) to Fe (III) Over the last couple of years the porcelain toilet bowls have developed a blue ring at the air/water interface When you scrub on the blue ring it doesn’t feel like there is a deposit present (like normal hard water deposits) The ring is unresponsive to ammonia (household) strong acid (6 M HCL) or strong base (Drano) as well as to hydrogen peroxide (30 %) (We haven’t tried a good reducing agent yet ) So my question is does anyone have an idea of what is causing the blue color Is it possible that porcelain reacted chemically with salts urea uric acid oxygen etc Not an earth-shattering theoretical question but I’m chemically curious as to what this could be if anyone has any ideas,hemija,5024

4342,The ideal gas equation (daresay law ) is a fascinating combination of the work of dozens of scientists over a long period of time I encountered Van der Waal's interpretation for non-ideal gases early on and it was always somewhat in a closed-form $${\bigl(p + \frac{n^2a}{V^2}\bigr)(V - nb) = nRT}$$ with $a$ being a measure of the charge interactions between the particles and $b$ being a measure of the volume interactions Understandably this equation is only still around for historical purposes as it is largely inaccurate Fast-forwarding to the 1990s Wikipedia has a listing of one of the more current manifestations (of Elliott Suresh and Donohue) $$\frac{p V_m}{RT}=Z=1 + Z^{\rm{rep}} + Z^{\rm{att}}$$ where the repulsive and attractive forces between the molecules are proportional to a shape number ($c = 1$ for spherical molecules a quadratic for others) and reduced number density which is a function of Boltzmann's constant etc (point being a lot of fudge factors and approximations are getting thrown into the mix) Rather than seeking an explanation of all of this I am wondering whether a more closed form solution lies at the end of the tunnel or whether the approximations brought forth in the more modern models will have to suffice,hemija,4350

4369,X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) is a particularly useful technique for examining the surfaces of all sorts of materials Organic monolayers are particularly difficult to characterize completely via this technique due to the fact that many carbon peaks do not differ much by chemical shift Traditionally quantitative information is obtained via a lot of guess-work and forced peak fitting It would be better to predict peaks shapes and peak positions beforehand to aid in the interpretation and prevent a terribly mis-guided interpretation How well can theory help the non-specialist with this I wouldn't have the time to develop a program to do this either Preferably one could point me to the right direction in terms of a research paper/software,hemija,8371

4378,In a series of papers in the early 1980s Michael Springborg explored an interpretation of the Wigner phase space function as an electron density in a six-dimensional $(q p)$ phase space He applied it with some success to several simple compounds Is the Springborg 6D phase model model used in modern molecular orbital modeling If not are there specific weaknesses that make it unsuitable for current computational approaches ADDENDUM 2012-05-14 In a world dominated by Hilbert spaces the orbitals of chemistry are interesting because they are one of the few places in physics where a 3D spatial image of the underlying quantum situation is consistently retained (My recollection is that Schrodinger liked such low-dimensionality approaches since they emphasized waves that could be visualized ) Alas the problem of course is that you need both position $q$ and momentum $p$ to get an accurate picture of the overall electron state Using a space-only 3D $q$ representation forces the analysis of molecules to flip back and forth at rather arbitrary thresholds between localized (position space $q$) and delocalized (momentum space $p$) views of the electrons in the molecules or metal crystals in question That bothers me both from a physics perspective and from a computational integrity perspective The problem is that there exists a very deep and profound physics symmetry between $q$ and $p$ in terms of how effects such as Pauli exclusion applies to fermions I find that simple symmetry nothing short of amazing because to me there's just nothing intuitive about the idea that half-unit spin would result in such extraordinarily similar behaviors in these quite different spaces At some level it seems to be one of those cases of that's just the way it works So it seems pretty reasonable that accurate modeling of orbitals of many diverse sizes likely requires this symmetry to be captured accurately If that's true this older work by Springborg (he still heads a research group BTW) strikes me as a possible opportunity to for taming some models making them smoother and more sane over a much broader range of molecular sizes That's because Springborg's 6D electron density functions -- if they work OK in broader contexts -- might help eliminate any need for abrupt switches between mostly position or $q$ 3D views (classic electron clouds whatever those really mean) and mostly momentum or $p$ 3D views A good place to test whether 6D $(q p)$ electron distributions might provide higher computational stability would be in modeling a range of lengths for a long-chain carbon polymer such as polyacetylene (I always pick polyacetylene for its simplicity but there are other good choices ) Springborg appears not to have explored that domain since as best I can tell his papers addressed mostly simpler bonds (I think; I don't have them ) The instabilities of approximate density functional theories may (or may not) be related to $(q p)$ transition instabilities That's not a question I can or should try to address as there are folks out there who know that domain orders of magnitude better than I ever will ADDENDUM 2012-05-16 I mentioned algorithmic opportunity and wondered what I meant myself by that since as @AcidFlask reminds the $q$ and $p$ basis sets are fully interchangeable in terms of representing any stationary wavefunction The issue is (again I think) one of accumulating uncertainty Picture doing some kind of calculation in the $q$ representation For a highly lo,hemija,4391
4379,I'm reading a book on carbon nanotubes (P J F Harris Carbon Nanotube Science to be specific) at the moment and puzzling about Stone-Wales or 5775 defects This is where two adjacent carbons undergo a 90-degree rotation about their mutual centroid and generate a defect consisting of two five membered rings and two seven membered rings as I've illustrated below (This is only supposed to be qualitative and is on a finite PAH fragment rather than a nanotube but you should get the idea) I note that tropylium ($\ce{[C7H7]^+}$) is aromatic as a cation and the ever famous cyclopentadienide ($\ce{[C5H5]^-}$) is aromatic as an anion so what I'm wondering is do the 5 and 7-membered rings in a Stone-Wales defect pick up either formal or partial negative and positive charges to maintain aromaticity in a fashion consistent with the rest of the structure P S Big props to F'x who attempted electronic structure calculations on the PAHs depicted regrettably without SCF convergence,hemija,4381

4397,In many tests for various radicals a &lt;color&gt; precipitate or &lt;color&gt; turbidity is mentioned For example lead acetate with chromate ions gives a yellow precipitate but hydrogen sulphide with potassium dichromate gives a yellow(or white) turbidity In the reaction itself the turbidity is noted as a precipitate with a down arrow but I'm wondering if there is any difference between the two It looks like turbidity refers to a colloid/suspension being formed but I'm not sure I'd like to know The physical differences/distinguishing features between turbidity and precipitate if any The observable differences/distinguishing features between the two if any,hemija,4398
