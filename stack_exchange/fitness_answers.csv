2016,fitness,The main difference is in the purity how much lactose and fat is left with the protein after filtering Whey isolate usually contains around 90% protein and whey concentrate is more like 70-85% If you have trouble digesting the lactose or are trying to minimize carbohydrate content then whey isolate would be a good choice Otherwise it probably doesn't matter; just pick the concentrate since it's cheaper in terms of protein grams/dollar
2039,fitness,I'd say this depends on your fitness the intensity of the workout and perhaps how much you've eaten the night before Assuming jogging means a running speed of about ~10 km/h or ~6 mph I expect you don't use that much energy that you can't cope with without jogging More importantly low intensity workouts mainly burn through fat and anything you would eat either isn't absorbed yet or only serves you energy for a couple of minutes which won't help you during 'longer' workouts Off course if you start to feel faint at the end of the workout you could take some glucose with you just to recharge when you need it So my advise go running and enjoy your breakfast after the workout Resources Skip breakfast before exercise to burn more fat studies say The Benefits of Exercising Before Breakfast
2019,fitness,Body weight squats will help with leg strength and balance Bicycle crunches and situps for oblique and core Pushups or elevated pushups for triceps I would avoid excessive bicep curls as big biceps will decrease your punching speed
2363,fitness,Get outdoors Because you're sitting inside all day it's great to get some fresh air I'd recommend either going jogging/running or cycling because they're very accessible and you can do it practically everywhere The big advantage of jogging is that it burns through calories like crazy and you're using a lot of different muscles If you have a pool nearby I would also recommend swimming During swimming you're using your arms in a totally different way than when working behind the desk It also strengthens your arm and shoulder muscles which hopefully let's you bear the stresses of working with stretched out arms all day Especially focusing on backstroke is good because when sitting behind the desk you're 'exercising'/using your breast muscles more so training the back muscles helps balance that Furthermore swimming is like a master-combo of all the arms movements anti-RSI campaigns make you do If your commute isn't too long you could cycle commute Ride your bike from home to work in the morning and from work to home at the end of the day This is easiest in the summer when the days are longer and there's less rain but possible all year If there's a shower available at or near work you can cycle long and hard and then clean up but if you go a bit slower you should be able to do it in regular clothes and just change your shirt and fix your hair when you get to work If you're depending on exercise to get around it's harder to skip it Doing a combination of multiple workouts every other day keeps it fun because you're not constantly doing the same It takes quite some discipline to do workouts with weights every day and if you're coming from being a couch potato it's all the more important your doing something fun Go join a team or set yourself goals to keep you motivated because while it's great that you've decided to want to get started you need to find something you want to keep doing as well Take it easy If you haven't done any exercise for quite some time chances are your fitness is very low Doing too much too fast can cause injuries Furthermore working out very hard with a poor physical condition is almost a guarantee of having terrible muscle soreness the next day If you have to endure that for several weeks not very motivating Instead of rushing to get fitter as quickly as possible focus on getting in better shape gradually You'll be able to workout much longer or harder in a couple of months if you rush it you'll probably not be able to work out at all
2070,fitness,Having guided a group of 'Start-to-Runners' ( similar to Couch to 5K ) I'm convinced anyone can get started with running (except those who can't walk properly) A couple of things you should keep in mind Don't overdo yourself because if you get injured you can't run at all and you'll lose any progress you've made Also you'll get less muscle soreness which makes working out out on a regular basis easier to maintain Besides speed is of no relevance when building up your fitness so it's literally a waste of energy Try running at a speed that you can still talk because your breathing frequency (and thus ability to speak) and your VO2Max (your capacity for exercise) are very strongly related The speed at which you can still speak is mostly a speed at which you're performing aerobic exercise If you run any faster you start to create more CO 2 than your body can get rid off which is what you want to avoid Try to run with a buddy because you have somebody to talk to during running and someone who can keep you motivated when things start to get tougher (and vice versa) Especially when running with someone of a similar level can be very motivating Why does this all matter Well you say you can walk for miles with no problem but your lungs start burning when you exercise So you need to do two things improve your general fitness so your lung capacity increases and your body is stressed less during exercise and find a sweet spot at which you're not walking but your lungs aren't burning either Generally people think you have to go fast to get a good workout but they're wrong Even jogging at 8-9 km/h can greatly improve your fitness when done regularly so take it easy and enjoy yourself
2025,fitness,I've had lots of success of RunKeeper Pro It comes with some preset training programs and you can customize them yourself Granted the programs themselves are only for single running sessions as opposed to a long term plan There are also training programs (Fitness Classes) available through the site though you have to buy them However you can set them up yourself as well RunKeeper Pro is available for free on both the iPhone and Android Which uses GPS to track your running speed and gives you feedback during your running session The results are automatically uploaded to their website When you login to their site you can see reports of your progress/activity over time There are also options to add reports for other workouts like swimming or rowing and also upload heart rate reports from your Polar to get a more complete overview of your workouts There's also RunKeeper Elite (19$/year) that offers access to more advanced features
2090,fitness,Morning is better because It's the first thing you do so no excuses as to no time You get it done Your metabolism increases for the rest of the day burning a few more calories You get energized and your muscles are stretched so you're more apt to take stairs walk a little further etc Save an extra shower
2059,fitness,You will find a lot of advice on the Internet about this one most of it is not demonstrated This is what the British Journal of Sports Medicine says about it Recent research suggests that the timing of the intake of protein related to exercise may be more important than the total amount of protein consumed in a day In the case of resistance training an intake of approximately 20–25 g of a high quality protein source in the hour after exercise appears to produce the maximum rate of protein synthesis So the total amount of protein consumed is not important the timing is But this amount is much more smaller what the supplementation guys say (to view the full article linked above you would have to subscribe for 30 days free)
2071,fitness,You should not need to empty your bowels prior to exercise If you are experiencing discomfort during abdominal exercise you should make sure your diet contains enough fiber to allow you to go regularly The Mayo Clinic has a nice list of high-fiber foods you are not taking excessive diuretics you are not taking in foods that cause excess gas or bloating About com has a list of foods known to cause excess gas and bloating If you are following all of those rules and still experiencing this problem regularly then you should consider talking to your doctor about it
2035,fitness,I think this depends on what your ultimate goal is If your goal is to be able to lift as much weight as possible bulk first If your goal is look like an underwear model probably cut first If your goal is general health/something in between I seen no reason why you can't just start working out without making any radical changes first and let your body gain muscle/lose fat as it will
2212,fitness,I prefer running outdoors for several reasons It can keep your mind somewhat more engaged than when using a treadmill (i e taking in the scenery etc ) (and possibly keep it away from the fact that you're exercising) You get to go somewhere and see things other than the inside of a gym As Greg mentioned the natural benefits of fresh air and sunshine are a huge plus and should not be underrated You can establish routes using bike paths neighborhood/city blocks hills etc to track progress as well as to switch things up to keep it interesting You're less likely to quit You can easily hop off a treadmill but once you've jogged in one direction you have to jog back ;)
2043,fitness,Looking in the mirror is a pretty good way I also got a great motivation boost when I received much more attention from ladies after losing 10kg
2085,fitness,You're question lacks a little bit of detail about what your workouts looked like but general causes for exercise related lower leg injuries are Running too fast puts massive strain of the soft tissue around your shin bone The only way to cope with this is slowly built up your exercise to allow the tissue to strengthen Run at a speed that you're still able to speak is a nice rule of thumb for not running too fast Running on hard surfaces if you're like me forces to run in the suburbs your feet hit the pavement hard with each step This causes the same problem as my previous point it will just happen faster on hard undergrounds If you can go to the woods or a park Running with bad shoes while the barefoot running crowd may disagree running on old or plain wrong shoes is bad Old shoes have degraded EVA which has bad or inconsistent cushioning Using your aerobics or tennis shoes for running is also a bad idea because while they may look similar they are really built completely different and often of different material as well Getting a pair of good running shoes will go a long way of reducing your chances of injury If all else fails you could get a pair of orthotics (don't overpay ) or compression stockings The first helps reduce movement of your foot in the shoe or make slight corrections to your feet roll off pattern The latter keeps your calf muscle in place and thereby reduces the stress on the soft tissue a lot The last part I can really recommend get a training plan I'm sure you've tried one before but this time get a training plan and cut your goals by 20% So instead of aiming to run at 10 km/h start out at 8 km/h instead of trying to run for half an hour start with 20 minutes Also I can really recommend a program like Start to Run or your C25K this forces you to alternate between walking and jogging for at least the first few weeks This greatly reduces the total stress on your soft tissue and should give your body time to start adapting But remember even when things start to get better stick to your plan
3045,fitness,It depends on the circuit you do You could alternate a circuit such that you don't do the same muscle group on consecutive days if you like working out every day If you are working your muscles hard you definitely want a 48-hour recovery period for each muscle group I did a pretty intense circuit program 3 days a week (M-W-F) so I could have weekends free And if you do it right you sure appreciate those days off But sometimes due to scheduling I've done circuits consecutively So long as you know your limits and keep good form you can avoid injury You can always do another activity for days in between I would suggest if you worked legs the day prior to not run a really long distance the next day A lower level of intensity like a leisurely walk swim or bike ride is nice but it's all relative to your activity level Listen to your body
2243,fitness,You should get yourself a decent heart-rate monitor and calibrate it yourself (as good as possible) What you do is you take a cycling home trainer and you follow the following protocol Maintain 80 rpm all the time Start cycling for 3-5 minutes at 100 Watt Add 30 Watt every 3 minutes Monitor your heart rate Assuming everything is more or less accurate your heart rate should be increasing more or less linearly until you start get above your anaerobic threshold after which it may start to increase steeper The point is it gives you a nice estimation of how much Watts you burn at what heart rate And since Watts can be roughly translated to kilo-calories (1 kcal = 1 163 Watt) you get an idea of how much calories you've burned Convert your heart rate over time to Watts and convert those to calories Though I'm sure most of them will have one built-in You can use your own 'calibration' to adjust the values If your a heart patient or you have any other diseases your mileage may vary
2110,fitness,The general rule of thumb is to add no more than 10% (measured in either time or distance) per week If you're just getting started running I would recommend the Couch to 5k program I used this last year to start running (after having never done any running in the past) and completed my first marathon in December
2130,fitness,Dr Stuart McGill suggests everybody should be able to hold the plank position for two minutes Once you are comfortable with this I vary my routine with elevated planks single leg planks stability ball planks side planks elevated side planks planks with feet on wall planks with feet on wall raising one leg to chest alternatively (I find this very tough)
2095,fitness,My girl friend and I used Your Shape (Xbox360 with Kinect) and in her case the calories indicated by the game were actually too low compared to what her Polar was indicating Now by no means is this scientific or calibrated but at least it means they're a nice estimate I'd say there's three things that are important Does the game make you keep coming back Because in the end any diet is based on sticking to it so if the workouts are fun and keep you motivated that's a plus Does it make you workout regularly Not only do you have to keep working out you have to do it at least ~three times to be a little bit effective Especially if you want to get better at something you have to regularly stress your body and let it recover so you become more fit Does it make you workout longer Your body needs about 30 minutes to get your fat-burning going so if you worked out for 15 minutes and then quit well then you only burned the sugar you shouldn't be eating ;-) If you can find a workout that keeps you busy for 30-60 minutes then it's becoming really effective Note that you may include warming up and cooling down as long as it keeps you moving And off course Kronos is absolutely right if you eat more than you burn during the workouts you don't loose anything But as your fitness improves so will your metabolism so it's OK-ish to eat a little bit more but then you have to promise me that you'll do an extra two sets of Wii Tennis This image shows different games and their metabolic equivalent task (MET)
2117,fitness,Sadly I don't have access to the journal to verify but Copacabana Runners is citing the journals Medicine and Science in Sports &amp; Exercise and Sports Medicine that reviewed over 60 detraining studies They found the following physiological effects after 2-4 weeks of detraining VO2 max down 4-10% Blood volume down 5-10% Heart rate up 5-10% Stroke volume down 6-12% Flexibility Decreases Lactate threshold Decreases Muscle glycogen levels down 20-30% Aerobic enzyme activity Decreases Running economy Unchanged So basically your body gets hit across the board Of course your mileage may vary depending on your level of fitness (the more you have the more you have to lose) the amount of inactivity you had (bed rest vs just no training) and most likely your age (the older you are the harder it is to regain what is lost)
2075,fitness,The bar should actually sit on the ridge formed by your shoulder blade whenever you grab the bar For instance see the following image for an approximation of where it should sit You really shouldn't have to be pushing forward much with your hands to keep the bar in place Also are you using any kind of padding on the bar Try to put padding on the bar if you aren't or take it off if you are I always preferred no padding as it makes the bar sit oddly on my shoulder blades Unless you are really super concerned with how much you can squat perhaps consider switching to nothing but front squats for your primary lower body lift instead of a back squat Here are some advantages of doing front squats
2078,fitness,This is not true Your body will process the food that you ingest and if the caloric intake of the food is greater than the amount of calories burned during the ensuing exercise you will gain weight You can have some carbohydrates before your workout if you find that your diet doesn't supply you with enough energy to not feel weak or excessively tired during your workout You can also add protein before your workout if you find yourself incredibly hungry in the middle of your exercise Again though if you take in more than you burn you will gain weight
2093,fitness,The most comprehensive answer I've found to this is at BodyBuilding com Essentially standard creatine won't make you retain water like micronized creatine and the standard creatine is used continuously whereas the micronized creatine should be used in a load-maintain-unload cycle The lack of water retention will change the look of the muscle you are building to be less soft if you're using standard creatine as well as lowering your weight/size
2107,fitness,Itching/tingling indicates an increase in bloodflow due to expanded capillaries and arteries This problem should go away as you increase your level of physical fitness If the itching comes with a rash though it's more likely to be exercise-induced anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction)

2941,fitness,It is possible to train the human body into needing much less sleep It is sleep quality and not amount that counts I have heard about people from military elite educations who make their body used to no more than 4 hours of sleep at night And they are still fit and surprisingly energized the next day ready to continue their rough training http //en wikipedia org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep http //studenttavern com/2008/04/live-on-2-hours-of-sleep-a-night-sleep-method/ http //www physorg com/news76867739 html First of all it all depends on ones own body Some need more some need less sleep to reach the same level of rest Then it also depends on your sleep quality You've got to fall a sleep fast and immediately go to the deep and good sleep and get quickly past the REM sleep (Rapid eye movement sleep) which is the more superficial dream sleep Then your body also has to be able to recover fast This follows your psysical condition level Lastly remember to eat healthy and have the right amounts of protein etc after training for the body to have perfect conditions for recovering fast If your body ever shows signs on burnout you should react This could be simply having sore muscles the day after the exercise if you do this exercise of these muscle groups regularly but with no soreness If you find yourself loosing focus and concentration and feeling tired then of course you need sleep In the end without training to need less sleep some people just appears to need less anyway without any effort It varies from approx 7-9 hours in average If you are the 6-hours kind of guy this could be just you and you should find out by about this Give it ago and keep focus on soreness and pain in the very early stages
2105,fitness,Evidence shows that more than 5 days a week training increases your risk of musculoskeletal injury Rest is physically necessary so that the muscles can repair rebuild and strengthen -- continuous training can actually weaken it Without sufficient time to repair the body will continue to breakdown from intensive exercise Overtraining often occurs from a lack of recovery time Some signs of overtraining are feeling of general malaise staleness depression decreased sports performance and increased risk of injury This image from pponline co uk explains why you need some rest Making sure to workout when you're muscles are slightly stronger than before your workout will allow you to literally built up your muscles
2101,fitness,Work into it slowly If you're experiencing that many problems from it often then you are likely training too hard I've known 70 year olds who could easily out-do me in the martial arts without breaking a sweat or getting injured It has far less to do with your age than with your experience and endurance
2166,fitness,Disclaimer I've worked for a company that makes pressure plates that allow you to analyze running patterns (with or without shoes) I've done research at a specialized running shoe shop and my father is an orthopedic shoe manufacturer So in short my opinions are fairly biased but by no means scientifically proven While md5sum names some great rules of thumb they apply to every shoe and don't help you determine what type of shoe you're looking for First a short note Adidas did a study way back in 1987 and found that most injuries come from Injuries caused by training Wrong intensity of training 12% Too rapid increase in intensity 9% Several others 9% Injuries caused by shoes Bad quality of shoes 17% Wearing your shoes for too long 11% Wrong kind of shoes 44% As you can see picking the right kind of shoes is pretty darn important So how do we pick one When you dissect a shoe it's made up out of two main components the upper which is the mesh leather or synthetic material + the shoe laces; the sole of the shoe which can consist out of several layers The first component is composed the same for nearly every pair of running shoe While the last around which it is made may or may not fit your foot ( see md5sum's answer for some excellent advise there ) you won't find much variety within a certain brand However you should note that this is mostly true for the running shoes Don't even consider running on those cheaper aerobic or tennis models because you'll fall in the trap Adidas found earlier The other component which is the sole of the shoe Now when I say sole I'm actually referring to everything that is below your foot when you're inside the shoe Trying to discuss all the bits and pieces that compose it depends strongly on the brand and their design-department When limiting choices towards endurance running and excluding fancier shoes that are meant for trail running or sprinting on a track You're left with a shoe sole that serves several functions offer stability and control of motion shock absorption and/or reduction protection against the underground and overuse/strain comfort enhancing your performance Shock absorption is mainly determined by your body weight rather than the type of shoe When you're lighter you can get away with having a 'softer' (as in lower shore values) soles than when you're heavier When I say shock absorption don't immediately think Nike Air because most absorption comes from flexing your joints rather than compressing your sole There are several 'special' features for motion control though you can safely assume that unless you have some severe disorder you probably don't need any of the extreme models With extreme I mean shoes with extreme angles at the heel or other gimmicks If you're 'normal' you fall in one of three groups those who pronate too much those who run neutral those who don't pronate enough (or supinate) Don't mistake this for the other three types people like to call out flat normal arched and high arched feet Hate to break it to them but since the shoes all h
2135,fitness,When you're walking you apply about 1 2 times your body weight to the ground in Newtons (Fz = 1500N in your case) When you start running this rapidly increases to two times or more Furthermore when you're walking you have bipedal phases which means your body weight is carried by both legs But jogging is characterized by going from bipedal to unipedal so all the force is being applied to the one leg and thus one knee You're perfectly capable of walking so what you are looking for is a speed at which the forces on your knees are higher than during walking but not as high as during running What's also important is to reduce the moment arm your bodies center of mass has towards your knee Because the muscles around your knee have to stabilize the joint the further you put your foot (and thus knee) away from your center of mass the larger forces they will exert on your knee Now the single most common injury in runners is a jumpers knee or patellofemoral pain syndrome You can bet that the tendons connected to your patella won't like the strains when you start to run faster So we want two things lower speeds and shorter steps Luckily with shorter steps and the same step frequency you automagically get lower speeds Now how do we know we're actually doing this Well one great way is to listen to your body or in other words talk to yourself out loud If you're able to talk normally you're walking at the right speed Because as soon as you start speeding up the words don't come out steady anymore You get what I mean I can't check it with a heart rate monitor but I'd bet it would be around 60% of your maximal heart rate which is ideally for burning fat If you're more serious about it you can get a heart rate monitor yourself and an accelerometer (like a step counter only fancier) and keep track of yourself but really nothing beats listening to your yourself
2123,fitness,Simply put; no Diet is 80% of the battle when it comes to weight loss Focus on this before any other area Also you cannot 'spot-reduce' fat Push-ups are a useful exercise but they should not be your only exercise Too many push-ups (and little else) will lead to posture issues Consider adding squats pull-ups planks etc - these are compound exercises that'll hit more than one area
2127,fitness,Your muscles increase in size during their recovery not during the exercise itself Therefore you should not be working muscle groups on consecutive days I generally find 2-3 times a week is ideal on non-consecutive days
2138,fitness,Reiterating Your body alone determines where fat is taken from or added You cannot target an area for fat loss or gain In 10 days 10 push-ups a day will gain you 100 push-ups worth of tricep and pectoral strength but will have no bearing on where your body decides to take fat from I've seen extremely obese people lose weight only on one leg for a month before starting to even out and lose in other parts of the body It's rare but it happens Eating cereals and milk only will not give your body all the nutrients you need and you'll likely encounter health problems Eating more calories than you burn will cause you to gain weight Likewise eating less calories than you burn is the only (healthy) way to lose weight
2223,fitness,Among many powerlifters the theory is that you should try to warm up very little Warmups are simply tests to spot joint or technique problems that could cause injury at full weight Anything more is needlessly tiring yourself out before you can get to the heavy lifts that really increase strength Intuitively you would expect to lift the most weight in your first set since you are the freshest the next most weight in your second set and so on Also intuitively if you were to apply your lifts to the real world you may not get to warm up If you must combine cardio and strength training into one workout then do the strength training first as you need to be fresh for heavy lifts and not for cardio Note I'm assuming that you are lifting for strength and doing cardio for heart health If you're training to become e g a competitive runner then this may not be the right advice I think I would save stretching for the end of your workout unless you are very tight and don't overdo it
2141,fitness,Yes it can cause lower back pain groin pain abdomen pain and other pains eHow has an article with some very good exercises to loosen the muscle and relieve much of the pain It walks you through the Side Plank Leg Lifts Ball Squats Lunges Hamstring Curls the Ball Raise
2145,fitness,You cannot target an area of the body for fat loss The body will determine where to add or remove fat Just stick with your routine and make sure that you burn more calories than you take in every day and you will be certain to eventually lose the gut It just takes time
2938,fitness,Well it's not outdated to be sure I'm an Exercise Science major at Ball State U and I hear that you should not sit down immediately after intense exercise I'm not exactly sure of the mechanism but if I remember right it is because of the way venous blood returns to the heart Muscle contraction is a large mover of blood back to the heart by pushing blood past one-way valves located throughout your veins (not arteries) For example when you finish working out your legs if you sit down you won't be using your leg muscles so you won't be pumping as much blood from your veins back to the heart If not enough blood gets back to the heart voila your blood pressure drops and you can pass out If you ever feel like you are about to pass out from anything cross your legs and squeeze your thighs and butt muscles It quickly returns blood to your heart allowing you to maintain blood pressure to the brain I promise it works
2143,fitness,Eating carbohydrates (sugars and complex carbs not fibers) will prevent you from getting light-headed weak or tired during exercise Often a single piece of candy or a cookie is enough to restore and maintain energy Play around and determine the amount that works best for you but don't take more than you need or you'll lose the weight-loss/maintenance benefits of the exercise
2147,fitness,With work you can improve your static-passive flexibility at any age However the gains you will see in time will significantly decrease as your age increases the older you get the harder it is to gain flexibility Stating that it's impossible would be entirely incorrect though See the How Aging Effects Flexibility section of Stretching and Flexibility - Flexibility by Brad Appleton for some of the scientific reasons behind this
2173,fitness,For many people full feeling is usually triggered by fat rather than by the mechanical stuffing of the stomach Red meats tend to be higher in fats than poultry and fish adults are advised to consume on average no more than 70g of red meat per day Poultry and fish are not red meat Pork sheep and beef are the most common red meats that you will encounter in a modern western diet If you are concerned about getting enough protein one could add tofu or tempeh to one's diet although tofu can be high in fat
2159,fitness,Try rolling over onto your stomach and doing a superman You can hold tension in the position or do reps similar to doing reverse situps ref site Also you might think about doing slow squats or wall sits where you focus on contracting both your abs and lower back Tense up so as to make the line between anus and belly-button as short as possible during this exercise - maybe you can replace your ab work at the same time
2377,fitness,If you are actually overweight meaning that your body considers itself to have excess fat then you can restrict calories significantly as long as you maintain a healthy lifestyle of exercise and can do so without becoming exhausted or excessively hungry Some people can reduce intake into the low hundreds (300-500) or even stop eating completely for a period of time and stay active and are healthy while others have to stay above 1000-1200 to maintain an active lifestyle Personally when I was on a weight loss plan I was able to go for a period of time eating 3-4 small meals (~500 calories per meal) each week This only lasted for a few weeks and during that time I lost an average of a pound each day During that time I walked 4-5 miles every day and remained almost as active as normal with only very slight changes Your body is intelligent enough to start burning the stuff it needs least first and will not start to burn needed/used muscle until you are down to your lowest healthy body fat percentage If you sit on the couch and don't eat your body will consider muscle fair game since it isn't being used Calorie reduction will also cause dehydration and the further you reduce the more severe the dehydration becomes Be certain to drink all the pure plain unaltered water (I stress pure water) that you need Drink water any time you feel thirsty Talk to your doctor before you decide to do any diet especially any form of extreme calorie reduction Some doctors refuse to recommend extreme calorie reduction for patients while others are fine with it but at least ask about the risk specifically presented to your health as your doctor will know your health history best Be absolutely certain that you do not continue a calorie restrictive diet past the point of reaching your minimum healthy weight or you will begin burning muscle The muscle you will burn includes your internal organs such as your heart Taking muscle from your organs is extremely hazardous to your health and can lead to long term or permanent damage
2167,fitness,Do something that doesn't require strength in the traditional sense (i e moving large weights) For example with yoga I often found myself shaking and occasionally falling flat on my face even though the exercise didn't seem hard or difficult at first Try holding the posture for 10+ seconds and it's a different story I also found that on average in my class women were doing better than men so this is probably a good thing for what you're looking for
2163,fitness,Typically a good carb indicates that the food has nutrients and is absorbed into the bloodstream slowly Whole Fibers husks and other materials provide fiber (which limits an insulin spike) and vitamins (e g Choose brown rice over white rice) Unrefined Refining processes typically remove nutrients In addition they tend to render foods such that they are absorbed faster (e g Avoid regular white flour in favor of stone-ground or better yet avoid flour altogether) Complex Natural foods containing complex carbohydrates instead of sugars or starches have fiber and other material that helps slow the absorption into the bloodstream (e g Choose beans over potatoes) Low-Glycemic The glycemic index (and the related glycemic load) is a measurement of how quickly foods are absorbed into the bloodstream Low-glycemic is typically defined as foods with an index no higher than 30-50 (normalized against table sugar at 100)
2215,fitness,There are many factors that contribute lack of energy but nutrition-wise one of the reasons is fast carbohydrates (especially sugar) Carbonated soft drinks are usually the worst offenders After you consume sugar it immediately ends up in your blood so your blood sugar level rises rapidly Your body counters it by producing more insulin to maintain stable sugar level Since it has to produce a lot of it ( insulin spike ) your blood sugar level plummets leading to loss of energy and the feeling of tiredness Cut out sugar and sweets out of your diet or at least limit it significantly
2171,fitness,I would suggest you look at solving your craving by eating fruits which are naturally sweet and not an unhealthy food You can vary this by eating different types of seasonal fruits or try and find your favourite I love to eat watermelon and rockmelon (canteloupe) after a workout If you like the flavour of chocolate not necessarily the sweetness you can try something like carob bars which have a similar taste
2388,fitness,Any time you perform an activity that causes joint pain or soreness you're doing long-term cumulative damage to your joints Typically soccer (football) should not cause knee joint pain There are a few different things that can cause this Incorrect or badly fitted footwear Try some different shoes Incorrect technique/balance/weight If you're overweight and running or if you're not moving with some fluidity (running smoothly vs pounding your feet) you'll hurt your knees Weak or previously injured joints Some people have weaker joints due to genetics or poor nutrition Others have weakened joints due to prior injury Typically damage done to joints especially to the knees is permanent and cumulative Every minor injury adds up even some of the ones you never feel If the pain persists check with your doctor and see what he recommends There are some great products now for people who have weakened joints to help alleviate any pain from activity
2326,fitness,I think that inherently there's nothing bad about minimal shoes but as the saying goes if the shoe fits wear it The shoes aren't for everyone so while it may be great for some they can be harmful to others A shoe like the Nike Free was designed to be used together with regular running shoes to mimic barefoot walking on a grass field as an additional workout Studies from the university of Cologne showed that the strength in certain muscles (especially the one used for bending the large toe) increased after training with the Nike Free But you can imagine what happens when somebody starts using them all the time rather than complementary to normal running shoes Instead of increasing strength you're far more likely to overuse those muscles instead I agree with a lot of the arguments that are being made in the advantage of these shoes but I would personally only recommend them to more seasoned runners and people without overweight or excessive pronation The first group has the technique and the fitness to cope with additional stresses that might arise from wearing them The other two points mainly exclude two high risk factors for getting injuries in the first place so I wouldn't recommend them to experiment Perhaps everyone could wear them but then I would advise them to start wearing gradually and preferably as much as possible The advantage of this is that you give your body the time to adapt and strengthen the muscles to deal with running without 'support' The main advantage of this off course would be that overall stronger muscles make you more resistant to injuries so that's always a good thing
2307,fitness,I head to NIH if I want non biased supplementation information The problem is that it almost always has to do in the context of disease so their write-up seems to be effective in the context of Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis Most research on glucosamine sulfate has measured its effectiveness on osteoarthritis of the knee However there is some evidence that it might also help osteoarthritis of the hip or spine Some research suggests that glucosamine reduces pain of osteoarthritis in the knee about as well as the over-the-counter pain reliever acetaminophen (Tylenol) It also seems to reduce pain about as much as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen (Motrin Advil) and piroxicam (Feldene) But there is a difference between glucosamine sulfate and these drugs in the time it takes to reduce pain The NSAIDs such as Motrin Advil and Feldene relieve symptoms and reduce pain usually within about 2 weeks but the glucosamine sulfate takes about 4-8 weeks Glucosamine sulfate does not seem to decrease pain in everyone who takes it Some people get no benefit Some research shows that glucosamine sulfate might not work very well for people with more severe long-standing osteoarthritis or for people who are older or heavier In addition to relieving pain glucosamine sulfate might also slow the breakdown of joints in people with osteoarthritis who take it long-term Some researchers hope that glucosamine sulfate might keep osteoarthritis from getting worse as quickly as it otherwise might There is some evidence that people who take glucosamine sulfate might be less likely to need total knee replacement surgery When I want to know things related with sports I use the British Journal of Sports Medicine keep in mind most of the content is behind a paywall Fortunately this study on glucosamine is not glucosamine supplementation can provide some degree of pain relief and improved function in persons who experience regular knee pain which may be caused by prior cartilage injury and/or osteoarthritis The trends in the results also suggest that at a dosage of 2000 mg per day the majority of improvements are present after eight weeks

2564,fitness,HFCS is usually 55% fructose and 42% glucose while sucrose is 50% glucose and 50% fructose molecule - this is why HFCS is slightly sweeter Glucose can be used as energy in every cell in the body while fructose like ethanol must be metabolized in the liver Fructose in nature is fairly rare (small quantities in fruits packaged in lots of fiber) so it is not surprising that the liver is not prepared to process the large quantities of fructose in our current western diet While HFCS is not in itself worse than sugar its low cost (made from subsidized corn instead of highly taxed sugar canes) makes it very attractive for food manufacturers to put HFCS into everything - soda milk sauces bread you name it So instead of ingesting a few grams of fructose many people on a western diet now ingest several ounces and that depending on who you ask is bad very bad or the single leading cause of the obesity epidemic Other sweeteners are not sugars; if they're harmful they're harmful in completely different incomparable ways For more information about the metabolism of sugar see Sugar The Bitter Truth
2238,fitness,1 kilo fat equals 7000 kcal or 1 pound fat equals 3500 kcal so if you keep your diet the same and start working out more that's how it takes to loose a kilo So assuming your 2 workouts burn 300 kcal together you need 7000/300 = 23 3 workouts to loose a kilo That would mean you would have to train nearly every day of the month to loose it Clearly that's not really an optimistic goal to work towards though on the other hand it's easier to keep up since you don't have to eat less (but not more ) and the result is probably more sustained than with some crash diet Off course increasing the intensity or the duration will chance those numbers but adding more 'exercise' is a more effective way of increasing the amount of calories burned in a day cycle to work take the stairs take a stroll during lunch etc Your other option would be to consume 200 kcal's less each day which would also result in a 1 kilo difference So doing them both would probably give you quicker results Funny enough if you add those two you get the 500 kcal that @Campbell mentioned so I guess his estimate seems about right
2939,fitness,This might be tough to hear but you should also consider the fact that not everyone is gifted with a body that can handle pro-athlete levels of activity If your legs are constantly tired/heavy and you see no improvement (and ESPECIALLY if you see backwards progress) I would say your body is telling you it's not ready for that level of activity (at least not yet) Back it off a bit let your legs recover and try easing into things I'm not saying you shouldn't push yourself but at the same time there is such thing as overtraining and at that point all the time you put into your training is counterproductive and wasted Stubbornness can be the enemy of progress sometimes
2217,fitness,If you're trying to build muscle and lose fat I've heard it's about 1 gram per 1 pound of body weight
2240,fitness,You lose weight because you either eat less or exercise more So it will depend on a combination of those two how fast you would lose weight Since 1 kg fat gives your body 7000 kcal of energy 7000kcal/14 days = 500 kcal/day It depends on your activity level your job and lifestyle whether that's a healthy goal The purpose of any diet is not just to lose but also keep off any weight you lose So rushing yourself only to swing back a couple of months later won't do you any good So what can you do Get more exercise but here exercise means working out at 50-60% of your maximal heart rate examples Take the stairs at work cycle to your work or for grocery shopping get a dog and walk it each day take a stroll through the park at lunch anything that will keep you moving On top of that like the other mentioned pick a sport and set yourself a goal I prefer running because you'll be burning lots of calories from the start and it will only get more once you're able to run longer While jogging for 20 minutes may seem like a bad exercise you'll be surprised how long you'll be able to run three or six months from now If you can run 5 km every other day you'll be burning at least 5000 kcal a month so you'll keep losing weight as long as you keep it up My take home message The goal is not to lose a kilo every 2 weeks now but to permanently keep them off for the rest of your life You're working out to improve your fitness so you'll be able to lose weight once you're fit enough And perhaps more importantly there's a strong correlation between your capacity for exercise and your general health So you should be working out regardless of your weight losing weight in the process just makes it more worthwhile
2231,fitness,Alcohol contains 7 calories per gram ~70 per fluid ounce and ~100 per jigger 1 It is converted in the liver to acetate which is given priority in metabolism in the same way that carbs &amp; protein are given priority over fat 2 As long as you properly count the calories in the alcohol you drink you should be able to work it in to your diet
2222,fitness,I would suggest the rule of thumb here is a dangerous guide Why because it may work for one or two iterations but by the third iteration if you have added 60lbs to your squats in 3 months it may be way too much This is something you need to listen to what your body is telling you and also a trainer
2639,fitness,Absolutely yes I used to be incredibly skinny but changed my workout completely on the advice of a personal trainer I used to work hard on biceps with zero results I changed my workout to focus on the major and largest muscles of the body e g legs and chest and my arms grew in size dramatically and that is after doing zero biceps curls or anything directly targeting the arms Exercises like Dead Lifts Machine Leg Press Military Press etc are key to building great arms
2224,fitness,Box Jumping is one type of Plyometrics exercise that is based off high impact jumping routines Plank is a type of AB workout that focus on holding a position with your back skyward elbows on the floor supporting the body while keeping your back straight maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to the hips to the knee while tip toeing While you are at the Plank make sure to keep breathing In fact keep a consistant breathing pattern while doing any exercise Keep your stomach butt and leg muscles tight during the exercise
2235,fitness,Get enough sleep and eat well and healthy Make sure you get enough vitamins whether from diet or supplements Assuming that you are eating enough make sure that the nutrients you are eating don't go to waste Try taking some enzymes for a while see how that works for you Finally train Lift some weights Be patient results will be slow (think years) Don't rush to big weights and creatine and other helpers Start slow and develop your body carefully avoid injury As long as you're motivated and you keep working at it you will see results Always remember that you want to grow muscles not fat
2263,fitness,To lose weight burn more calories than you eat This can be by working out more or eating less To gain muscle you need to challenge your muscles This is most often done by lifting heavy weights You also need a calorie surplus in order to grow To improve stamina do the thing that requires stamina longer or more often If you interpret lose weight as lose fat then there's no reason you can't do all three things at once I don't agree that there are types of workouts just different goals Someone that just wants to lose fat might just run on a treadmill but that doesn't mean that lifting weights wouldn't be equally (or even more) effective at that goal
2239,fitness,Your best bet is to practice doing sprints the 100m shouldn't be too long a distance You can start smaller and practice doing 50m sprints and then build up You should also make sure you get a decent amount of sleep the two nights before the event Because you will be doing sprints during training and before the event I suggest you do a reasonable amount of warming up and stretches There is also another exercise where you sprint about 10 - 15 metres touch the ground then sprint back another 10 - 15 metres and do several repetitions So you are practising taking off from a point
2259,fitness,I haven't seen any scientific proof as to whether you should or shouldn't work out straight out of bed While you might be a little stiff at first simply strolling for five minutes should be more than enough to get everything going Sitting indoors for one hour won't nearly stress your body as much as just walking a little bit So as long as you start the workout a little relaxed there's probably nothing bad that could happen to you As for pulling a muscle or straining your back listen to your body If it's start complaining slow down and take it easy nobody said you should be pushing yourself and there's zero benefit to getting injured I agree with @Eelvex that making sure you drank something before you go (or taking something with you) is important because you probably didn't drink anything for the past 6-8 hours For the rest you're body will adjust itself quickly enough when you start walking I have no experience with weight lifting in the morning but I reckon the same applies there start with something light to get the blood flow going and increase the loads from there
2252,fitness,No keep resting would be the commonest medical answer for this (acute bronchitus) My view is given all the hours of training you've put in it's better to complete the marathon slightly slower than to escalate the condition in the cold air and not complete it at all
2311,fitness,To understand what anaerobic means let me explain a couple of things about where your energy comes from When at rest most of your energy comes from fat But as soon as you start to exercise your metabolism kicks in and increases proportionally to your rate of work But because burning fat happens too slow and requires a lot of oxygen (CO2) to burn you gradually start to burn glycogen (CHO) instead The relation between these two is pretty much inverse which means that the harder you start working the less fat and the more glycogen you start burning All the while your heart rate and oxygen uptake increase pretty much linearly This phase is called the aerobic phase ( with oxygen ) because you have sufficient oxygen to burn both the fat and the glycogen Until you start reaching a point where your cardiovascular (heart + vessels) or respiratory (lungs) system are starting to lag behind the required lung ventilation This point is called your lactate threshold and indicates that you're starting to accumulate too much lactate in your blood Lactate is the by product of anaerobic glycolysis because you burned the glycogen with insufficient oxygen A second thing that happens is that your red blood cells get saturated with carbon dioxide (CO2) it can take up less oxygen to supply the muscles with 'fresh air' The phase above the lactate threshold is the anaerboic phase If you keep increasing the load from this point on your body is starting to saturate and you're rapidly depleting your glycogen resources Unless you're a highly trained athlete these levels of exercise (80-90% of your maximal oxygen uptake) are generally hard to sustain for long periods of time But as you can see a lot of factors are involved in determining your where your aerobic phase starts Your heart has to be able to increase its heart rate and increase the blood pressure your lungs have to ventilate old air out and new air in and transfer O2/CO2 with the blood blood has to transfer O2/CO2 with both the lungs and the muscles and your muscles have to produce energy contract and relax and transfer all the involved products And all these factors together determine your anaerobic capabilities This is also dependent on how well you are trained The more trained you are the higher levels of lactate you can sustain the more glycogen you have in your muscles or even the more blood you have (and many more) So how does this apply to you Assuming your maximal heart rate lies at 200 bpm and you're working out at 170 that's 85% of your maximal capacity My cynical guess is that your heart rate monitor is slightly off One way of determining whether it's correct is trying your own VO2Max-test only without the actual oxygen testing Follow a standard testing protocol to test how your heart rate increases when you incrementally increase the home trainers wattage until you can no longer sustain the load That's a fair guess estimate of your real maximum and will give you an idea whether 170 bpm is around or above your lactate threshold I greatly simplified several aspects if you have any questions or find that I need to explain something just leave a comment
2266,fitness,There are several ways to measure your body fat percentage Sportsmedicine About com has a nice description of the most important ones in order of their reliability Underwater Weighing - Hydrostatic Weighing One method of body composition analysis in which a person is weighed while submerged in a large tank of water is called underwater or hydrostatic weighing This method of determining body composition relies on Archimedes' Principle of displacement which states The density of fat mass and fat-free mass are constant Lean tissue is more dense than water Fat tissue is less dense than water Therefore person with more body fat will weigh less underwater and be more buoyant Skinfold Thickness Measurements Because underwater weighting it is complicated and cumbersome and requires special equipment most exercise physiologists use simple skinfold measurements to determine body fat percent The American College of Sports Medicine says that when performed by a trained skilled tester they are up to 98% accurate Bioelectrical Impedance Bioelectrical Impedance is another method of assessing body fat percentage There are a variety of body composition and body fat analyzers and scales available for home use that provide more than just total weight measurements These devices determine total weight the percent and amount of body fat muscle mass water and even bone mass While the readings can be affected by hydration levels food intake skin temperature and other factors if you follow the directions and take the reading under similar conditions you will obtain the best results

2291,fitness,Yes Your target heart rate is based on a percentage of your maximum heart rate The formula is (((220 - Age) - RHR) * 0 7) + RHR This formula will figure for 70% of your maximum based on the Karvonen Method Your Resting Heart Rate (RHR) should be averaged over a few days (3-5) You should take it upon waking before getting out of bed and count total beats for one minute
2341,fitness,Nose has natural air filters for all sorts of things; temperature regulating filters for example Nasal breathing is very important at cold weather However there is a lot of debate concerning the general advice to breath through the nose during cardio workouts You need a lot of oxygen and maybe nose is too small to deliver enough Many runners breath both through nose and mouth at the same time (I should add some sources later - please edit if anyone has some handy)
2287,fitness,Lifts in no particular order Wrist Curls Reverse Wrist Curls Farmer's Walk Wrist Roller Reverse Curls (these interject the outside of the forearm almost as much as the bicep) Other things that help When running do so with tennis balls in your hand so you force yourself to grip the entire time The gain is nominal but it is another chance to work your forearms while exercising When at work periodically squeeze on a stress or tennis ball when not typing/writing or otherwise using your hands When lifting make sure to squeeze the bar/weight as much as possible no matter what lift you are doing If it's a machine grip the handle as hard as possible This forces you to tighten not only your hands/formarms to work them but also makes you tighten the rest of your body There's really no such thing as a lift that only works parts of your body - if you are doing them correctly
2289,fitness,Nothing will totally prevent or 100% effectively treat Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) To treat DOMS though you can try Ending your workout with aerobic exercise will decrease it Taking aspirin or ibuprofen will reduce the pain You shouldn't take ibuprofen before working out This will only treat the symptoms and will not reduce healing time To prevent DOMS A good warm up will go a long way in reducing the soreness Avoid sudden major changes in workout type or length Work into it For more tips (some with significantly less scientific backing) see the Sports Medicine article on About com
2349,fitness,The standard advice is a good meal 3 hours before race/training refuel (like a small gel+water) 20 minutes before start begin fueling 15 minutes after you start hydrate every 15-20 minutes use bars/gels/drinks every 10-30 minutes Another thing is that you can calculate how many calories you'll burn and be sure to get that much from your gels/drinks in regular intervals Generally you have to try and see what works for you (I don't know how well are all these documented but they get used a lot) Be careful when running for 2+ hours you may refuel too little but you may also do so too much don't drink too much don't refuel too much; it's dangerous
3302,fitness,Shoulder injury is often caused by weakness in or overloading of the rotary cuff It's badly developed by most people since they don't really train it Badly executed Bench Presses seem to be a major cause too by putting too much strain on the shoulders So in this light I think it's important to train the muscles involved with your rotary cuffs Infraspinatus Supraspinatus Subscapularis Teres Minor There are a few very easy to execute exercises that can help in strengthening your cuffs with only a dumbbell Lying Shoulder Internal Rotation http //www youtube com/watch v=Vw8HVQuMpNc Lying Shoulder External Rotation http //www youtube com/watch v=VuHuKq3elzQ&amp;feature=related Of course you can use cables in stead of the dumbbells if you happen to have those EDIT BUT If you ever feel a strain on your shoulders or pain while exercising go see a kinesiologist
2386,fitness,I have been running for about twenty years and always found the logic behind barefoot running quite compelling If you want to read more about it after watching that video you can look at Harvard's Skeletal Biology Lab's Barefoot Running Website or just watch the compelling videos showing ground reaction forces for different types of foot strikes After becoming a father my running slipped to about four months of running a year leading to a big July 4th 10K in Atlanta GA (The Peachtree Road Race) followed by eight months off A few years ago I decided to give barefoot running a try during my normal off season I destroyed the soles of my feet a few times by running with bad form and trying to do too much too soon but they healed up surprisingly quickly -) ONE CANNOT PUT TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON GOING SLOWLY WITH BAREFOOT RUNNING Eventually I bought a pair of Vibram Fivefinger KSOs and this made a huge difference I would start out running a short distance barefooted to help me with my form then put on the Vibrams and run a mile or so Running in Vibrams made my feet sore for the first few weeks This was muscular soreness most noticeable when I got out of bed each morning and the muscles in my feet were stiff The soreness would go away after about five or ten minutes Eventually I stopped having sore feet and gradually worked my way up to a mile barefooted followed by three more in my VFFs - all on concrete and asphalt I still run this way and really enjoy it Last year I ran the last three miles of the Peachtree Road Race barefooted and it was hilarious I got quite a few comments -) Now I consider myself to be a Natural Runner running as I would run barefooted but using minimalist footwear to protect the soles of my feet from the friction of concrete and asphalt After running in VFFs for 5 years I am sure that I will never go back to traditional running shoes though I also do not think barefooted running is practical if you are running on concrete and asphalt One can do it but it would take me more than a year of committed effort to develop the necessary toughness in the soles of my feet to put in 15 or 20 miles a week this way These surfaces are just soooo abrasive From my current perspective the notion that you would take a complex shock-absorbing structure like your foot and encase it in a shoe that filled-in the arch and presented a flat surface to the ground then add shock-absorbing materials to the shoe and expect that to be better for your feet seems somewhat comical Of course that's just my opinion I could be wrong -) One additional note if you are going to experiment with barefoot running read the advice found here on barefootrunning com It is the best advice I found online While it discusses the foot strike it does not put too much emphasis on it If you really try to land on your forefoot you will blister your foot Focus primarily on the other advice like landing with your feet under your hips and bending your knees more and lifting your whole foot rather than pushing off with your toes I find it helpful to think that I am placing my forefoot on the ground then shifting my weight to it Of course this happens very quickly and the effect feels more like landing on your whole foot but your forefoot contacts the ground first then your foot and ankle absorb much of the impact compared to a heel strike UPDATE 03/20/2012 I just found this video that gi

2301,fitness,If you are looking to build mass you should rest 45-60 seconds between sets of 8-12 repetitions for optimal gains This timing builds optimal muscle mass and hypertrophy If instead you are looking to improve your strength or endurance you should be looking at a 3-4 minute break between sets You'll want 4-6 repetitions with heavier resistance for strength or 16-24 repetitions with lower resistance for endurance The Art of Manliness published a great article with an extremely simple strength/endurance training routine See World Fitness Network
2317,fitness,The effectiveness of commercially available sports drinks This study from the University of Tasmania suggests so Our conclusions are 3-fold First because of variations in drink composition and research design much of the sports drinks research from the past cannot be applied directly to the effectiveness of currently available sports drinks Secondly in studies where a practical protocol has been used along with a currently available sports beverage there is evidence to suggest that consuming a sports drinks will improve performance compared with consuming a placebo beverage Finally there is little evidence that any one sports drink is superior to any of the other beverages on the market
2360,fitness,Theoretically you can loose weight with doing just one exercise However if you want to loose more weight you have to raise the number of calories you've burned You can do this by exercising under higher loads or working out longer But fitness machines often fail at mimicking the natural increase in loads on an elliptical trainer when you increase the loads going 'round' get's harder everywhere I've made a small model of the forces during an elliptical workout when you increase the load from the light to the dark blue arrow the forces get proportionally higher everywhere But the problem is when you're leg is stretched away from the center of your body those 'small' forces have a large moment arm (towards the center of your body) So while it's not an issue for the forces to increase under your body it because extra hard when they increase far away from your body This causes it to be pretty hard to go faster and faster on your home trainer even when your fitness increases So that option is basically out as there's almost no home trainer that doesn't make the same mistake Your other option is to workout longer which happens to be a very good choice when you want to burn fat Because burning fat happens mostly at lower intensities so actually when you start to work out harder your body shifts gear and moves away from fat to other 'faster' fuels Therefore it would be better to burn 500 kcal at 60% of your maximal heart rate than at 80% because at least you got rid of some fat There's another reason why you need to work out longer fat is a slow fuel and your body doesn't really start to burn fat until you're 30 minutes into a workout Luckily nobody said you had to workout hard to get to this point so I'd advise you to use a long relaxing 'warming up' just to get your metabolism going and then get going with the real deal So basically no you don't need to go out and buy anything else But if you like some variation I'd really recommend you to start running outdoors instead Running does become heavier 'naturally' when you increase your speed and it's generally more pleasant to workout outdoors as well
2316,fitness,In a groundbreaking 2003 experiment scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology found that 50 minutes of hard running on a treadmill or riding a stationary bicycle significantly increased blood levels of endocannabinoid molecules in a group of college students The endocannabinoid system was first mapped some years before that when scientists set out to determine just how cannabis a k a marijuana acts upon the body They found that a widespread group of receptors clustered in the brain but also found elsewhere in the body allow the active ingredient in marijuana to bind to the nervous system and set off reactions that reduce pain and anxiety and produce a floaty free-form sense of well-being Even more intriguing the researchers found that with the right stimuli the body creates its own cannabinoids (the endocannabinoids) These cannabinoids are composed of molecules known as lipids which are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier so cannabinoids found in the blood after exercise could be affecting the brain Phys Ed What Really Causes Runner’s High

2370,fitness,You should be taking your supplements daily to maintain your load Both of those supplements do good things not only for workouts but for your body in general including the brain I would suggest continuing to take them in the same manner that you take them on on days However most people I've come into contact with suggest taking creatine and L-glutamine twice a day once being before bed or mid evening and once either in the morning or prior to/following your workout When and how you take your supplements really depends on how your body reacts to them I'm with you on the sugar why they have to add so much sugar to our food these days I'll never know
2331,fitness,In my own experience I have regularly attended a gym with a friend when I was just out of high school He was a few steps ahead of me in terms of fitness and strength and he was quite committed This was really helpful as it meant I would try harder to reach my goals I have also joined gyms and made friends by attending regularly You tend to find a few of the same people showing up at the same time if you attend the same time regularly Meeting people this way is less 1 on 1 and means you can do your own thing if you want but also makes the overall experience more enjoyable and encouraging to keep returning
2338,fitness,Plyometric exercises are specialized high intensity training techniques used to develop athletic power (strength and speed) Plyometric training involves high-intensity explosive muscular contractions that invoke the stretch reflex (stretching the muscle before it contracts so that it contracts with greater force) The most common plyometric exercises include hops jumps and bounding movements One popular plyometric exercise is jumping off a box and rebounding off the floor and onto another higher box These exercises typically increase speed and strength and build power If you combine Plyometric sessions while maximizing the cardio side of it with minimal rest time you can achieve high lung capacity The small window of rest with these sessions will increase your heart rate and force your body to adjust to the right breathing pattern (of course done w/ moderation and safety in mind) Plyometric is considered a must in all athletic training Soccer players recovering from ACL surgery participate in Plyometric to get back into competition shape Plyometric will increase your performance in any sports including running if it is done right
2350,fitness,When I was in the Army we did wide-arm push-ups elevated push-ups diamond (close-hand) push-ups push-ups with resistance (someone putting pressure on your back or a sandbag on your back) and push-ups on our knees The variations in resistance targeting different muscle groups and working towards a burn-out all contributed to breaking the muscle down to the point where it would grow back stronger during the recovery period Lastly endurance is about numbers You have to do lots of sets and lots of reps with a rest period of at least 1 day in between For instance we did push-ups Monday Wednesday and Fridays

2385,fitness,In general the method I would use would be this Find a sports trainer or other resource for your specific sport When I say trainer I don't mean coach You want the guy that would prescribe an ice bath or massage vs the guy who doles out the workouts Through that resource determine what physical capabilities are needed for your sport Devise a way to test your capabilities to identify any areas of weakness you might have The test could emphasize different physical aspects like muscle strength flexibility endurance stamina range of motion hand-eye coordination etc It all depends on your sport Using the results of the test craft a training plan that will minimize or eliminate those defficencies Retest yourself to see how well you have improved after being consistent with your training plan after enough time has passed ( Enough time can vary depending on what you're doing but a good rule of thumb is six weeks )

2367,fitness,It is quite well known that average adult human being needs about 8 hours of sleep a day In terms of feeling well rested It does not matter how long you sleep rather what quality is the sleep You are getting The same goes for muscle building Sleeping 7-8 hours every day would be the optimum More than that and you risk oversleeping which in my experience is much worse than sleeping too little There is a good e-book on this subject How To Sleep Less and Have More Energy Than You Ever Had As to the time question It is never a good idea to go to bed immediately after a workout You should plan the workout to end at least 2 hours before You go to sleep to have the best sleep and the best rest Also if Your goal is weight loss then the best time to workout is in the morning You have just woken up Your energy levels are quite low carbohydrates are not available so the body has to burn fat instead @Louis In answer to Your comment Right after the workout Your energy levels are at their highest It stands to reason that even if You were tired and sleepy before You will most definitely be not after a good workout Furthermore our biological clock is temperature oriented That means that when You go to sleep Your body temperature is lowered That is a prerequisite for a good nights sleep That is why we sleep best in a cool room rather than in a hot room Right after the workout Your body temperature is quite high so there will be no sleep for You This is from a biological standpoint In regards to the 2 hours that is not a specific time limit That is just something that was mentioned in the book and I usually follow it just as a guideline
2382,fitness,There's a nice article on developing mental toughness on Ralph Jean-Paul's blog The main key to developing mental toughness is the same as developing a muscle repetitive use and practice Interestingly the development of mental toughness is also a spiritual battle (Biblically) (see the last paragraph where Paul speaks of beating his body into subjection) and while normally I wouldn't throw a religious link into the mix here I think it's important to recognize on some level that in order to successfully develop a better stronger attitude the spiritual side is certainly an issue I would consider looking into most of what are known as the Spiritual Disciplines as a method for developing mental toughness These include fasting meditation prayer servitude simplicity etc All of them will have a positive effect both on you and on those around you and will do wonders at developing your character and inner strength Note I own the blog referencing Paul's spiritual battle However this same information can be found at many other sources through a quick search on Google Addressing comments about the spiritual aspects of mental toughness take a look at this quote from the Fort Hood Resiliency Campus of the US Army's web site Any human being functions in three modes i e Physical (Body) Mental (Mind) and Spiritual (Soul) These three aspects of our lives are not independent from each other but dependent and usually intertwined They are reflected in our behavior our relationship to others and also seen in the way we respond to challenges and crisis The Stoic philosophy is another spiritual discipline that leads to mental toughness and that is not a religion which you might want to look at One excellent source of information (links on-line books videos training courses etc) is the Stoic Foundation

2401,fitness,The odor is standard (although possibly more acute) bacterial foot odor Spraying them with Lysol after use will make them go longer without needing washed as will putting them in a (very) mild bleach/water mixture Basically anything to kill the odor-causing bacteria (laundry detergent is typically not anti-bacterial) washing them in the sink with an anti-bacterial soap by hand is more effective than the laundry You'll probably still need to wash your feet (or hit them with the Lysol/bleach as well) Other possible suggestions to kill the bacteria (and thus eliminate the funk) are vinegar (white) UV light air them in sunlight
2410,fitness,The number one thing you can do is train with a coach who knows about good running form Many cities have various track clubs that are friendly to people who are less than lightning fast However that costs money takes time and may not be ideal One activity that I used to learn a lot about my running style was setting up a video camera to record me running on a treadmill I set up the treadmill to have me run in a couple of different ways about the pace I use for my long slow runs and my racing pace both with and without shoes I then stepped through each of the videos frame by frame to get an idea for how my foot was hitting and rolling as I ran Unfortunately because the video was from the side it made it hard judge whether or not my feet were actually hitting straight on and how far left or right they were After watching each video in slow motion I stepped through the shoe and barefoot videos side by side to understand how my kick was working and more importantly what sort of pressure I was putting on my feet while landing It wasn't pretty and made it obvious why my knee hurt so much with shoes I was hitting on my heel with my leg fully extended There was nothing to absorb shock except my heel Using that information I've been paying extensive attention to my running form while on training runs -- regardless of whether or not I'm barefoot Mainly this consists of making sure that I land further up on the ball of my foot with a slight bend in my leg and that my heel hits the ground after the ball of my foot An easy way to tell if you've done this right is by listening to to the noise that your footfall makes Landing on your forefoot is usually much quieter This will however end up hurting your calves It took me about four weeks before I was comfortable running with a forefoot strike without focusing on my food landing My calves still haven't built up all the way but that's coming For what it's worth I got the idea of recording my running from a running analysis video by NJ Sports Medicine on YouTube

2417,fitness,I'm not sure about the origin but there was an interesting article in the local newspaper about the All Blacks (the New Zealand rugby team/world number one team) in which it was stated even the lightest member of the team was overweight (based on BMI) and four of the players were obese As professional sportsman these players are all very well built and very muscular but hardly what you would think of as obese I think measuring your body fat might be more helpful as being X KGs/X cm tall with 5% body fat vs 25% body fat is a big difference You could probably also form your own judgements as to whether or not you are overweight but I'd say while BMI might be a useful guide it's hardly definitive as to what your ideal weight is Hope this helps Good luck

2427,fitness,You don't want to overdo electrolytes so if you're going to get them from fruits or vegetables don't add much of anything An avocado is a great example to get potassium Also bananas are great as well Presumably unprocessed banana chips (dehydrated banana) would be a good start Celery is also a good way to up your sodium levels All of your electrolytes can be gotten from purely natural sources and your body will absorb them slightly easier from these natural sources The basic thing to remember is what your electrolytes are sodium chloride potassium magnesium and calcium Potatoes avocados and bananas are good for potassium leafy green vegetables like lettuce and cabbage for magnesium cheese and yogurt for calcium and celery for sodium chloride Just plain table salt will also work for sodium chloride High fiber isn't a big concern Fiber is regulatory not diuretic As long as you're going normally to start with then having the extra fiber won't cause you to need to go in the middle The big thing is the amount you'll need to consume to balance your electrolytes may actually cause you to need to go so I would start switching over to the natural stuff slowly to see how you perform Example 1oz of cheese on a few leaves of lettuce 1/4 - 1/2 of an avocado and a celery stalk for a salad That will add a load of electrolytes but only be about 1 - 1 1/2 cups of food Start that during practice so that if you do have to stop to go you can get the timing down to where you can eat it long enough before you begin that you'll need to go before your run
2460,fitness,I stumbled onto a great resource of swimming information Swimsmooth com that happened to have a couple of great tips I'd like to share 1 Focus on exhaling rather than inhaling The reason you want to breathe is not because you have a lack of oxygen You only consume a couple percent of the 20% oxygen you breathe in no the reason you breathe is to get rid of the CO2 So focus on exhaling as fast or powerfully as possible With focus I mean practice it regularly while swimming more slowly and really try to get rid of all the breath in your lungs as fast as possible When you've exhaled you're able to inhale again so mastering exhaling gives you more flexibility in when you decide to inhale again (you never have to wait) 2 When you're not breathing keep your head still Your head is like the steering wheel of your entire body so keeping your face still looking down means your body will have a steady posture too If the swimming pool has lines on the bottom it greatly helps to swim straight above because it gives you a point of focus 3 Breathe in your armpit As Swim Smooth puts it When you move through water you create a 'bow wave' with your head and body just like a boat does The shape of the bow wave means the water level drops along the side of the swimmer's face This creates a trough either side of your head and body that is beneath the surface level of the pool - so there's air lower than you might expect there to be Try to limit unnecessary movement so simply rotate your head by moving your chin towards your armpit Normally the trough created by your head should be large enough to allow your mouth to be just above the water so you can breathe in 4 Don't lift your head If you listened to my previous tip you already knew you not supposed to lift your head but simply rotate it One important reason you don't want to lift your head is because it's very straineous on the back/neck muscles but more importantly it causes your legs to sink lower This slows you down and makes the swimming heavier thus increases your need for air 5 Don't over rotate your head A picture says more than a 1000 words so here's another great example from Swim Smooth If you rotate your head too far remember your entire body is rotating with This is bad for several reasons your leg might be kicking near the surface of the water rendering it pretty much useless; your arm dives too deeply making it heavier to lift out of the water again and your increasing your frontal surface within the water which is also very bad 6 A lack of body rotating hurts your breathing The first reason for this one is obvious if you rotate your body you don't have to rotate your neck as much to be able to breathe But there's more so much actually that Swim Smooth has a whole article about it that I highly recommend Other than because you need it for a good technique I think there's one important point Those muscles are much more effective if you rotate slightly because when lying face down it means more strength would have to come from your breast muscles instead of the very strong b
2453,fitness,There are four major strokes in swimming Freestyle Backstroke Breaststroke Butterfly stroke Of these freestyle is the fastest and most efficient swimming style In my own experience the butterfly stroke is by far the hardest to maintain for long distances How you fill in your workout depends on two factors how well can you swim and how hard do you want to be working out How well can you swim If you have a poor technique or a poor condition swimming will become quite heavy to sustain at a decent speed very quickly The poor technique causes you to swim inefficient because having a wrong posture creates a lot of unnecessary drag and inefficient breathing The poor condition means fatigue will have a negative influence on both your speed and your technique A combination of both will lead to a complete downward spiral Why should you care Well the point is you want to be swimming for a long stretch off time enough for some real cardio-exercise You don't want to be 'wasting' energy and end up completely wasted half way through You should only make it harder on yourself once yourself once you have a decent baseline condition Pick the strokes that allow you to swim for as long as possible How hard do you want to be working out Like running swimming is something you can make as hard as you want to If you swim faster it will cost you more energy You can also add tougher strokes (like butterfly stroke) or add resistance (wear a t-shirt or use paddles) to increase the resistance The other option is working out longer though unless your serious about swimming long distances I reckon this is the last option for everyone Why should you care This means that if you always swim for half an hour and you're swimming condition + technique start to improve you can either do more in those 30 minutes or add some minutes to make it harder So say your already capable of swimming half an hour non-stop what should you be doing As with every other workout you can either try to swim faster (more miles/hour) and just swim non-stop or use interval training to push yourself harder during short stretches of time combined with periods of relative rest For pushing yourself faster I'd recommend the latter Though you should always combine it with 'rest' days where you simply swim non-stop and perhaps focus on improving your technique rather than pushing for speed A 'typical' swimming workout with intervals could consist out of a 400m warming up it doesn't really matter what stroke you swim just that you get your heart rate up to a nice and steady level Then you start swimming 100/200m intervals you have two options with how to approach these swim freestyle as fast as possible without going over your lactate treshold and then rest Depending on your condition you could take off every 1 45 or 2 min this means the faster your swim the longer your allowed to rest But don't over do yourself you're not trying to break World Records here swim freestyle with a certain time goal in your mind (not your fastest) then after the 100m swim backstroke or breaststroke for 50m I prefer backstroke because you train your back muscles which helps with some variation and more importantly you can get to breath non-stop which is often the most important thing during your 'rest' You could also try to focus on swimming faster for longer stretches of time An often used method for this is using a 'pyramid' built up It basically goes like 100m --> 200m --> 300m -->

2437,fitness,If you do them on the same day your body has at least one full day of recovery between workouts Running is largely a cardiovascular exercise once you're in good enough shape to do it effectively (which at 5K I would consider you to be) Effectively it will get everything loosened up warmed up and slightly tired for you to have an extremely effective workout So you'll build more strength and tone (or bulk if you work it that way) by doing your other lifting and exercising immediately following your run Having a complete day of rest (or 2) in between workouts enables the body to more effectively and completely repair itself meaning you'll be working everything again from it's peak and not keeping your body and muscles stressed all the time Currently your routine works almost your entire body every day and that's literally just too much; your body never gets a rest

2470,fitness,Stretching is clearly a very controversial subject Instead use of stretching as a prevention tool against sports injury has been based on intuition and unsystematic observation rather than scientific evidence ( Source ) A second major reason that many coaches and athletes still view static stretching as an important preactivity ritual is the belief that it reduces the likelihood of subsequent injury This belief is based on the idea that a tight muscle-tendon unit is less extensible without stretching which means that its tolerance for elongation is lower This intuitive concept has resulted in a widespread belief that stretching will prevent muscle and tendon strain ( Source ) Like many sports physicians Dr Bartoli tells her patients that rather than stretching before physical activity they should do the sporting activity at 50 percent of the target intensity ( Source ) Before I continue I should note that I have found no study that focused on stretching after working out But based on the results from other literature reviews I don't think the effect after a workout is much different Also the lack of scientific interest in the topic should make one highly skeptical as well Shrier points out several important points to consider Both the muscle-tendon unit and the joint capsule may limit ROM [range of motion] Flexibility is usually considered the ROM limited by muscle-tendon and mobility is usually considered the ROM limited by capsule/ligament Stretching must be differentiated from ROM There are many individuals who have excellent ROM but never stretch and many individuals who stretch but continue to have limited ROM Therefore different injury rates in people with different ROMs may not be related to the effect of stretching but rather to the underlying interindividual variation in tissue properties anatomy etc Stretching immediately before exercise may have different effects than stretching at other times and should be considered as a separate intervention Whereas there is considerable amount of clinical data on stretching immediately before exercise there is much less data on stretching at other times Some people claim that negative results in some studies are due to improper stretching technique Because the effect of stretching are believed to occur through changes in stiffness and ROM an improper technique implies that the ROM is not increased If ROM is increased without causing an immediate injury then by definition the stretches were done properly Warm-up is not synonymous with stretching In the colloquial sense warm-up means any activity performed before participating in sport Used in this sense stretching is only one component of warm-up and if stretching is included in the pre-exercise activity I explicitily state that stretching was used The other component of warm-up is participating in an activity that requires active muscle contractions This type of warm-up can be divided into general or sport-specific warm-up In a general warm-up the objective is to increase body temperature In sport-specific warmp-up the acitvity is the same but performed at a lower intensity Be aware that the mechanism of action will dictacte whether one type of warm-up is superior to another The term dynamic stretching is currently used differently by different people but in es
2480,fitness,Exercise depends on several factors your muscles for doing the actual work and their local storage of energy; your blood as a transfer system of O2/CO2 and energy; your heart for making the blood flow; your lungs as a transfer system of O2/CO2; your liver as a supplier of energy; your nerves for stimulating your muscles So depending on the intensity of your exercise all of these systems will be taxed After a certain amount of reps you have depleted all your muscles local storage of glycogen and they will need to recharge before they're able to perform work again After the local storage is gone your blood will have to resupply your muscles to deliver you new energy This also means that if you start working on another muscle group that muscle group has to share its new supplies of energy with the muscles that are recovering Even if you were to rest your body has a storage of lactate acid it needs to process and an oxygen deficit to compensate for This requires oxygen but more importantly produces a lot of CO2 your body needs to get rid off This is called having an oxygen debt If you switch muscle groups you don't give your body time to recover from its oxygen deficit If you're trying to work out on your maximum lung capacity you have to subtract a part of your oxygen supply for the oxygen debt so you're not working out maximally anymore you're simply out of breath Furthermore if you can't supply your muscles with sufficient oxygen it will anaerobically burn it's fuels While they're a great fuel it won't last you very long and it will most likely hamper the amount of repetitions you can make with the same fuel Because as soon as you rest then the fuel get's processed again but you already moved on to another muscle group If your body feels tired your central nervous system (CNS) might also inhibit any further exercise It won't stop you from trying but you probably won't be able to perform the amount of reps you could perform with sufficient rest So all in all even if you were to switch muscle groups your body needs some rest between repetitions How much rest your body needs depends on how heavy the exercise is how fast your performing it and how many times you perform it per repetition

3234,fitness,Wide pull-ups Source This blog I can't believe nobody has mentioned this yet The muscle that gives the overall appearance of 'broad shoulders' is the 'Latissimus dorsi' or your 'lats' Wide pull-ups are a great exercise for targeting this region as well as your shoulders (deltoids) arms (both biceps and triceps) and forearms (from gripping the bar) For proper form be sure to cross your legs and lock your knees to prevent swinging or cheating by using momentum (no frog kicking for 'just one more' allowed) Raise and lower yourself in a slow/controlled manner I can't stress how important it is to maximize both the raising and lowering during the exercise Forget about the number of reps you can do (this isn't an exercise to impress the 'how much can you bench ' guys at the gym) If you do them 'right' you'll feel it Note If you don't have the strength to pull yourself up to the bar yet grip the bar and start by jumping up the position where your eyes are level with the bar then lower yourself down slowly This will help you build up the strength needed to be able to do the full motion Source Wikipedia If you're going for more of the 'thick neck' or 'no neck' look or what I like to dub the 'meat head' look you'll want to target your 'Trapezius muscle' or 'traps' Source Wikipedia The exercises that exclusively target your traps are 'shoulder shrugs' - done with either dumbbells or a barbell 'upright row' - done with either dumbbells a barbell or using a bar attached to a weighted cable It may surprise you but the 'broad shoulder' look has little to do with your shoulders and more to do with upper/lower body proportions Update Added some more specifics about the wide pull-up exercise including tips on proper form and and easier variation for those who don't have sufficient strength to do the full motion yet
2474,fitness,Sport socks can make a world of difference especially during longer workouts or if you have sweaty feet They help reduce the moisture and friction which becomes more important the longer you run In diabetics they sometimes add patches of low friction material to the insoles because this reduces the shear forces on high risk areas Good sport socks do the same they allow your foot to slip a little bit relative to the insole which greatly reduces the friction and thus reduces the chance of blisters Regular cotton socks tend to get wet after about 20-30 minute workouts and don't transfer the moisture away from your foot sole Therefore any negative effect from the moisture like increasing friction get's worse over time Furthermore wet cotton socks can loose their shape and start to wrinkle or bunch up After several wash-wear cycles cotton socks have been noted to become abrasive which can potentially be irritating on the skin Proper socks are also known to improve the fitting of a shoe because they're generally thicker in some important areas whereas regular socks are more homogeneous in their composition So I'd advice anyone who has to do some serious running for longer stretches of time to wear sport socks
2562,fitness,There are both physiological and neurological reasons to build in rest Even elite athletes who take on volumes of training most of us would not be able to comprehend have smart periods of lighter training and even full rest periods Physiologically training works by stressing the body just enough that the adaptation allows you to recover and the body overshoots a bit so you end up stronger/more coordinated than before Doing this too much however will back fire due to a principle known as GAS (General Adaptation Syndrome) You can read about it here http //www healthnewsnet com/gap html Basically it ultimately leads to exhaustion and dramatically increases risk of injury In training steadily (3 - 5 days per week) for the past 10 years I've had no serious injuries because I build in rest On the flipside I know people who refuse to stop believing more is better and go non stop until an injury has them on their back for months Much better to build in the rest periods when you can control them than to end up being forced to rest because you didn't allow your body the recovery it needs You'll often hear you are less likely to need rest if you alternate muscle groups After all if I work my legs my arms are resting right This isn't entirely true for two reasons Reason one unless you're using totally isolated movements like single arm dumbbells machines etc your other muscles do participate to an extent Your core is always stabilizing your torso your leg muscles work to provide stability while your upper body is moving etc Reason two and more important every workout taxes your neuromuscular system There is a neurological effect This is where the idea of muscle memory comes from and the reason why some people can be extremely strong without having large muscles - it's because their neurological system reacts to the workout by improving coordination of motor units the bundles of nerves that fire to contract muscle (when you lift a heavy weight or a small one motor units are helping you do that and it's just a question of how many are activated at once) Any type of training will tax your central nervous system and too much training can lead to fatigue This fatigue can tax your adrenal system and raise cortisol levels a stress hormone that also makes it more difficult to burn fat Literally you'll stress your body to the point your metabolism slows you burn fat less efficiently and stop making strength gains So yes please build in rest If you train 5 - 6 days per week then a week of light activity is probably fine but even elite athletes I know try to take at least a week off of ALL training at least once per year I've found if I train just 3 - 4 days per week then I can go a lot longer without having to take a longer period for rest

2497,fitness,According to Physiology of Sports and Exercise Every endurance exercise session should conclude with a cool-down period Cool-down is best accomplished by slowly reducing the intensity of the endurance activity during the last several minutes of your workout After running for example a slow restful walk for several minutes helps prevent blood from pooling in your extremities Stopping abruptly after an endurance exercise bout causes blood to pool in your legs and can result in dizziness or fainting Also you should remember that intensive exercising effects your entire body your heart is pumping your lungs are ventilating your blood is racing through your body your muscles are contracting your liver is producing energy If you were to suddenly stop your body will slightly lag behind your abrupt change in exercise intensity (or the lack thereof) When you've been working out near the lactate threshold your body has also been piling some amount of lactate If you lower the intensity of your workout such that you get enough oxygen your muscles will start using lactate as a fuel and get rid of it Because burning lactate creates a lot of waste products like CO2 and creatine kinase it's advisable to keep up some level of activity so that your body can get rid of it easily During workouts your body releases hormones such as adrenaline and endorphins if you were to abruptly stop exercising you maintain higher levels of these hormones which can cause a feeling of restlessness or a sleepless night Another good reason is that when you exercise your muscles stretch and shorten a lot If you were to stop abruptly you leave your muscles in a somewhat misaligned state By cooling down you gradually limit the range of motion back to the state it would be in when you're in rest So basically the goal of cooling down is giving your body time to readjust itself to the change in requirements However a study by Law and Herbert from the university of Sydney indicated that cooling down did not reduce delayed-onset muscle soreness Which might indicate that this isn't directly related to residual waste products Furthermore Tanaka an exercise physiologist from the University of Texas claims it's an understudied topic and that there's no science behind the advice I'd like to point out that my while my answer is based on the physiological processes going on during exercise I don't have any publications to back them up Lucky for me neither has he
2496,fitness,According to Physiology of Sports and Exercise Every endurance exercise session should conclude with a cool-down period Cool-down is best accomplished by slowly reducing the intensity of the endurance activity during the last several minutes of your workout After running for example a slow restful walk for several minutes helps prevent blood from pooling in your extremities Stopping abruptly after an endurance exercise bout causes blood to pool in your legs and can result in dizziness or fainting When you've been working out near the lactate threshold your body has also been piling some amount of lactate If you lower the intensity of your workout such that you get enough oxygen your muscles will start using lactate as a fuel and get rid of it Because burning lactate creates by products like CO2 it's advisable to keep up some level of activity so that your body can get rid of it easily I would therefore suggest to reduce the intensity of your workout For example in running start jogging at a speed your still able to talk This ensures you get plenty of oxygen (to pay your oxygen debt) while still maintaining sufficient blood pressure to let your body adjust itself In cycling you could keep up high revolutions but with very low resistance or in swimming you could vary your strokes focusing on getting back to normal breathing As md5sum suggested a recommended cool down for weight lifting is a short cardio workout (stationary bike treadmill etc) Depending on the intensity I'd recommend a bike over a treadmill as this is non-weight bearing which can be pleasant after heavy squats/leg exercises
2505,fitness,[I will treat this from a purely mechanical point of view as this is my area of expertise -- the actual body mechanics are much more complex but the effect is similar ] From a mechanical point of view the most efficient way to propel yourself on the bike is to step on the pedal so that the distance between your heel and the pedal is maximized Ideally this place would be your toes; however due to the toe joints your ability to do so is rather limited as the the flexible joint will change the way power is transmitted through your foot Thus the optimal place to step is the ball of the foot -- it has a good surface area for good contact and the muscular mass which reduces the reaction from the pedal and dampens somewhat vibrations from the bumpy road As to why the most efficient place is as far from your heel as possible See this handy force diagram below that I found when writing my answer (image license unknown) Although not exactly what we need here it will come in handy in the explanation How this whole biking deal works You step on the pedal with force PF which creates a torque Tc with arm `CL' and which is transmitted through the drive train system to the real wheel which due to its traction with the ground pushes you forward Mechanically the greater the arm CL the greater torque you get for a given force PF They are related linearly as follows Tc=PF CL Simple enough You might be tempted to think that if you make your pedals long enough you can exert enormous amount of force and indeed this is so Archimedes famously said Give me a place to stand and I shall move the earth with a lever The thing is your feet will need to travel much farther to cover the same distance as with shorter pedals -- but requiring a negligible force There ain't no such thing as a free lunch in mechanics as well But wait this only takes into account the length of the pedal not the foot Indeed Your foot only serves as an extension of the pedal effectively increasing the torque you produce by increasing the lever length If the length of your foot is Lf then the torque will become Tc=PF(CL + Lf) effectively increasing the torque you produce
2558,fitness,A proper squat involves the hip joint ending up below the knee joint as seen from the side (see the image above) This is called squatting below parallel Many studies indicate that squats when performed correctly and with appropriate supervision are not only safe but may be a significant deterrent to knee injuries A look at weight training injury rates and using common sense when thinking about the third world squat how you sit on any low surface (e g toilet) and the fact that olympic weightlifters - who routinely squat crazy loads WAY below parallel - can still walk should also be fairly convincing

2518,fitness,A big part of choosing a weight loss regiment is choosing something you are going to continue doing Zumba appeals to a lot of people because it has a dance aspect which makes it fun for them (There is a stigma associated with working out in a boring old gym ) If you are going to continue to do Zumba over other workout routines then definitely stick with it As to how effective it is that really depends on the length and intensity of your workout There is a lot of movement to it and if you are actually working hard (and sweating) then you are burning off calories That means assuming you watch your diet as well you will lose weight and achieve muscle tone I would suggest that you do a combination of activities (helps mix it up too) Zumba - A few times a week This is your cardio/weight loss exercise Weight/Strength Training - Do this once or twice a week Doing this actually helps you burn MORE calories when you're doing your cardio portion because your muscles require more energy It's been shown time and time again that individuals who supplement cardio with weight training maintain a healthier physique and reduced weight Eat Correctly - Do NOT starve yourself or go on any fad diet Eat properly Healthy proteins (chicken fish etc) Vegetables Fruits Don't come home from a class and gorge on ice cream or you will see no weight loss (and probably the opposite) However it is good to reward yourself at times (at least a couple times a week) with a small treat Keep those three things in mind and make sure you're working out at the proper intensity level and you will see the changes you are looking for
2519,fitness,Hands facing away tends to focus on your back and lats Hands facing toward you emphasizes the biceps As far as which to use when that depends on what you are trying to accomplish with that workout Obviously the two still use a lot of the same muscle groups so take that into account if you're going to use both
2523,fitness,First you'll want to pick a set of exercises to do and learn how to do them with proper form Then you can start increasing the weight and set a schedule In general I would recommend a full-body workout that hits all the muscle groups with a few compound lifts However I'll try to craft a workout for you here that fits your stated goal with the equipment that you have For exercises try Dumbell curls Tricep extensions Forearm reverse curls (make sure to do these after the regular curls above) You can experiment more as you get comfortable but this might be a good workout to start with You can do it as often as you feel energetic and not sore but a good starting goal might be 2x/week; err on the side of an extra day of rest rather than straining yourself because muscles grow when they recover I would suggest doing 3-5 sets of 8 reps of each with a couple minutes rest between each set As far as how much weight to use you need to first use a very light weight and make sure that you have your form down (pay attention to the tips and the motions in the videos) When you're comfortable with the movements add weight for each exercise gradually If you're doing 8 reps per set then you'll want a weight at which you'd fail after perhaps 10-12 reps A few other hints that will help pay off down the road Keep your core tight when doing these exercises Squeeze the bar when you're lifting especially for the dumbell curls Lower the weight slowly; these are called negatives and can be as beneficial as lifting the weight up
2535,fitness,I wouldn't worry about supplements just yet if you're only getting back into exercising now They are intended to finesse results The core of your plan should be healthy diet and exercise; you certainly don't need supplements to lose weight or to be healthy in general If you are going to pick between a focus on protein and carbohydrates I think that you're going to be better off with the protein Protein is used to build up muscle and also helps suppress your appetite Carbohydrates are extra energy which you really don't need; certainly you'll pick some up in your diet (I'm not necessarily advocating for or against a very low-carb diet like Atkins - although it will work)
2542,fitness,The way muscles are put to work is more electrical than chemical Yes the electrical 'twitches' give off chemicals it's not like you could drink a magic potion to get them where they need to be Even worse you wouldn't be able to dosage them which would probably result in a tremor/rigor mortis kind of reaction How it works Your nerve stimulates motor units which starts to release ACh which binds with the muscle fiber If the stimulation is steady enough and enough ACh is released an electrical charge will be transmitted along the muscle fiber and open ion gates this is called depolarization and sends off an action potential From http //legacy owensboro kctcs edu/ This causes the SR to release calcium which bind with troponin on the actin filament (within the muscle) so that the myosin crossbridges can connect According to the sliding filament theory this then shortens the muscle fiber because mysion is drawn into action Then ADP (from ATP) connects to myosin and it releases again but if there's enough stimuli others will reconnect Shortening the muscle further and further From http //legacy owensboro kctcs edu/ Given that the ion gates have to open to start this whole process you need nerve stimulation to get even start a contraction That off course leaves out that you need your heart and lungs to be working to get rid of all the waste and supply your hard working muscles with oxygen And if you wanted to maintain it for longer than a minute your liver has to start supplying you with new energy sources So I suggest you look into muscle physiology some more I can highly recommend Physiology of Sport and Exercise because it covers almost anything regarding exercise you'd want to know
2565,fitness,It depends on your goals If you want to lose weight don't consume food after a run; wait up to two hours if you can If you want to to go hard your next run consume food (80% carb / 20% protein) within 30 minutes
2548,fitness,You could have tried different exercises to see which strained your wrist and which did not (with light weights) - it may be that pulling exercises wouldn't strain as much as pushing or vice versa However the right answer is to just stay off your wrist and let it recover Losing a few weeks is really not that big a deal and re-injuring yourself is If you feel restless during that time take the opportunity to focus on something else - lower body work or cardio endurance I had a similar scenario last summer I injured my knee and really couldn't do any lower body exercise I took the opportunity to really focus on my bench press and let the knee recover I didn't end up losing that much lower body strength and have long since gained it back
2553,fitness,There are a few things to mention here Consistency and persistence is key I know that being stuck can be demoralizing but if you want to lose weight and live a healthy lifestyle you can't have thoughts of giving up at the first roadbump Having said that if she has been dieting consistently for a long time it can help to take a short break Long term dieting will affect hormone levels and metabolism Taking a week or two off can allow your metabolism and hormone levels to return to normal levels making future weight loss easier Note this does not imply pigging out for a month straight Just a week or two of eating maintenance should do it As you lose weight your caloric requirements go down This means that the same amount of food that was effective for weight loss earlier is not as effective after losing a considerable amount of weight She may need to eat even loss or exercise more If her clothes are getting looser then it's possible that she is losing fat but her weight overall stays the same because she's also gaining some muscle This isn't a bad thing - it's healthy and will help future weight loss efforts

2581,fitness,BMI is best suited for analyzing populations not individuals A single person might carry more muscle than the average and a BMI calculation would label them as obese However when calculated for thousands of people (which can be done with BMI since it's so quick/cheap/easy to measure) the fluctuations tend to average out and BMI is accurate enough to be useful For personal use measurements like body fat percentage blood pressure etc are far more accurate

3901,fitness,What matters more than the time on the clock when you eat is the content and frequency Consider the following facts about the pancreatic function It takes 6 hours from the last carb you ate for your pancreas to switch from producing insulin to producing glucogon Glucogon is a fat burning hormone and is designed to maintain a minimum blood sugar and converts fat to sugar It's the opposite of insulin which is designed to maintain a maximum blood sugar and traps excess sugar as fat Your pancreas is designed to have cycles of producing insulin and glucogon The most common time when we have more than six hours between meals is when we sleep If we get the suggested 8 hours of sleep and we eat carbs right before bed you'll only have had 2 hours of glucogon production To improve your body's performance you may want to delay breakfast If you have several small meals 3 hours apart and all contain some form of carb your body will be producing insulin the majority of the day Remember it's designed to have cycles of insulin and glucogon production If you have those same small meals 3 hours apart but only two contain carbs (breakfast and dinner) your body will switch over to producing glucogon in the middle of the day as well One of the reasons that many diets suggest no meals within 4 hours of bed time is that two hours after you sleep your body is starting to burn fat That gives at least 6 hours of fat burning at night and more if you eat an hour or more after you get up
2587,fitness,Definitely sounds like a flexibility issue You need to work on getting more mobility in your ankles and hips Goblet squats are a good exercise that tends to automatically enforce good form in the squat If you don't keep an upright position you fall over I would recommend combining goblet squats with a dumbbell or kettlebell with ankle and hip mobility exercises
2599,fitness,http //www leangains com/ This is the site of Martin Berkhan who is a guy who has based his entire coaching on the concept of intermittent fasting He is a Swede but the site is in English It's quite a large repository of info and it includes a bunch of before / after testimonies from some of his clients Personally I've had very good results with the Leangains approach of a 16hr fast each day combined with a paleo diet I've dropped at least one pant size in the first 2 - 3 weeks I don't know how much of that is due to the paleo or the IF I try to do some walking or short intense exercise while fasted (it wouldn't be a good idea to do a metabolic conditioning type of training as those require a lot of glucose and you could end up in glucose deficit ) Alternatively Tim Ferriss advocates a protein fast once a week to trigger autophagy and other cell renewal mechanisms
2611,fitness,There is no timing for consuming protein There is not a single study that demonstrates eating protein at a specific time will somehow boost recovery or muscle gain What's far more important is just your protein intake on average over time Your body is actually quite adept at regulating your protein metabolism You have something called an amino acid bank that contains amino acids and when your body requires certain proteins it can withdraw from this bank and when you consume proteins it can deposit That's an oversimplified description of a complex biochemical process but the needs for protein are actually quite small The idea you need tons and tons of protein is more marketing than science (after all supplement companies have to sell their protein shakes so of course they want you to believe you need tons of it) The body actually adapts to protein intake and excess protein is simply converted (via a highly inefficient process) to energy and burned rather than used to build muscle tissue One of the best online articles I've read with respect to protein intake is Lyle McDonald's series The bottom line you'll find is that there is a lot of myth and speculation there really is no magic to consuming protein If you train excessively hard you don't recover immediately after the workout but in the days after the workout and therefore it's just average intake over those intake that counts not specific protein on a given day or hour of the day
2629,fitness,Simple answer if it hurts don't do it Pain is the body's way of telling us that something is wrong The absolute worst thing you can do to yourself is ignore the pain and keep going Just eat healthy exercise what you can and once your problem is resolved and you are through the proper recovery then go back slowly into your routine The single best thing you can do for yourself when you have an injury is just let your body rest
3734,fitness,As a long-distance runner who does CrossFit I have looked into this a good bit and experimented with myself over the last two years While CF doctrine says (at least at two gyms in DC) that endurance is a degraded mode of power I have come to the conclusion that practice makes perfect If you want to do your best at the marathon you need to do a lot of long runs If you want to crank out 100 pullups unbroken you need to do a lot of high rep pullups This is pretty basic and it makes sense to me There are no shortcuts I don't know the science behind how our muscles work but I believe that we perform better after repeated experience After two years of CrossFit I am a much more fit person able to do much more with my body than run long distances but my long distance running times have suffered Simply put CrossFit makes you better at doing CrossFit which is a a pretty darn good proxy for functional capability in life However if you want to win the 15K go to runners world and find a good training program
2610,fitness,There is not a normal rate because of so many factors including stress amounts of sleep age metabolism gender etc However as a good rule of thumb I've found that aggressive fat loss for men can typically be 1 - 2 percent of their body weight and for women 0 5 - 1 5 percent That means at 300 pounds losing 3 - 6 pounds per week for males and at 200 pounds losing 1 - 3 pounds per week for females is possible Typically I've found people can lose more weight than that per week but when it's faster than those guidelines the extra weight is often water weight and muscle Water weight is an illusion - it really isn't helping you with your goals so when you first switch to a low carb diet for example and lose 8 pounds in a week you've really only burned a few pounds of fat and then flushed water from your muscles Muscle weight or what we call lean mass also isn't good to lose because that will slow your metabolism and actually make it harder to burn fat
2616,fitness,Exercise I suggest you walk If you will be spending the majority of your time consumed in your programming addiction and taking care of your new child the best exercise for you is walking Walking will drastically reduce the chance of you getting an injury which could stop you from doing any form of exercise Also more intense forms of cardio or weights require a good amount of sleep to be effective Walking is also something you can do with your baby If you currently aren't doing any form of exercising now start with a 20 minute walk the first week Over a month or two try to increase the walk to an hour Flexibility If you decide to do more intense cardio (or even if you don't) I suggest you work on flexibility There are some great books on stretching and there is also yoga ) Flexibility will help prevent injury (especially as your baby turns into a toddler) Yoga also consists of breathing exercises which have been reported by many as beneficial to their overall health Sleep I suggest you do your best to keep it consistent This means going to bed at the same time and always sleeping a minimum number of hours Eight hours is recommended but some research has shown the older you are the less sleep you need I would avoid the 20 minute naps in your condition as the REM sleep you would get from a solid 5+ hours of sleep would be very beneficial I have not had a child yet but I believe it will be difficult so good luck If you are sensitive to caffeine do your best to avoid it a few hours before sleeping Also pay attention to the last meals or foods you eat before sleeping Some may help you sleep better and others may ruin a potential good night sleep Diet Use the general BMI scale and your a low exercise level to determine how many calories you should eat in a day I would suggest a low fat (less than 20%) and a low protein (less than 25%) diet Stick with a variety of vegetables fruits whole grains and if you are not a vegetarian fish lean meats and low fat dairy products If you are not getting 4-5 different colors of foods every day from vegies/fruit and/or if you are not eating any meats I would suggest looking into supplements (but that's a whole different long conversation) If you have a hard time keeping within the recommended calories try to slowly increase more fiber into your diet Both fiber and protein have shown effects of curbing hunger Do you best to avoid bleach/enriched flour processed sugar and salt Drink plenty of water (8+ cups a day) Congratulations on the baby and good luck

2625,fitness,There are several great posture building exercises One is to lay on your stomach on the floor (or on a pillow or something if this makes your back hurt) with your arms above your head Then raise your pelvis off the floor and one leg and the opposite arm (pelvis right leg left arm or pelvis left leg right arm) This can be extended into Supermans once you're comfortable doing them by simultaneously lifting both arms both legs and your pelvis at the same time Another is to simply do Planks Lay on your stomach resting on your forearms pull your body up into a strait line with only your forearms and toes touching the floor and hold that position as long as you feel comfortable then lower yourself back down As Sparafusile stated you can also do rows One of the easiest ways to exercise the muscles exercised doing rows is to lay down on your stomach on a bench with dumbbells on either side and lift them up until your elbows are straight out to your sides and your elbows are bent at a 45 degree angle About com also has a great article with more exercises to strengthen back muscles You should take into consideration your age as well and any other conditions which may play a part in having a hunch in your back such as scoliosis or damaged vertebrae or discs If any exercise causes you extreme discomfort or pain stop doing it immediately and talk to your doctor
2668,fitness,To understand how these two sports might conflict we need to delve deeper into how muscles are controlled Chad Waterbury had this nice picture showing how a motor unit touches several muscle fibres I suggest those who don't know what motor units are start reading up a little bit -) Taking the biceps as an example this muscle has about 200 of these motor units to stimulate all the muscle fibers But you want to contract your muscle they don't all go fire at the same time This is due to the size principle motor units of the smallest size will be recruited first For a more detailed explanation I can recommend Human Physiology The Mechanism of Body Function As this picture shows your muscle fibers are divided into roughly three groups First the green ones are recruited these are your Type I fibers meant for endurance Then when you start to recruit more motor units (by increasing the force of the contraction) you recruit the yellow ones these are your faster Type II fibers but as you can see they aren't the strongest muscle fibers If you would contract even harder you would start recruiting all your motor units (well as much as possible) and you reach your maximal power output What does this have to do with shooting If you lift a lot of heavy weights you're mostly training that last group of muscle fibers When you do this enough you're muscles start to adapt to become better at it However my hypothesis would be that this influences how your muscles recruit muscle fibers Now if keeping a gun stretched out requires 20% of your biceps forces that means it has to recruit the yellow muscle fibers But since they work in an on/off kind of way they'll recruit a surplus of fibers and thus produce more force than required so you have to counter it with your triceps But that muscle is also a lot stronger so your muscles have a very hard time at load balancing to keep your arm steady Furthermore weight lifters aren't trained for fine-grained motion so regardless of whether my hypothesis is entirely correct you're training your muscles for the wrong kind of exercise So yes I'd say they are somewhat conflicting
2945,fitness,I'm in agreement with Gary Taubes when you want to put it in terms of sustainable weight loss and maintaining healthy organs Over production of insulin causes your body to resist its presence so that its role in building muscle is limited just as the fact it is converting your excess blood sugar to fat The pancreas is also responsible for producing a complimentary hormone called glucagon which is used to convert stored fat to blood sugar The pancreas is designed to cycle between insulin and glucagon production and consuming too many carbs severely limits the production of glucagon Essentially by limiting your carb intake to say once a day you remain in a fat burning state longer You still need to keep your total calories lower than what you burn in a day to lose weight However you can lose faster and more sustainably if you limit your carbs I've been told that you can reverse insulin resistance after three weeks being in the state of ketosis It might take longer if you have a modest amount of carbs
2655,fitness,As I answered here I personally don't recommend stretching unless the workout requires it Witvrouw et al found that Recently it has been shown that stretching is able to increase the compliance of human tendons and as a result increase the capacity of the tendon to absorb energy When the sports activity contains no or only low SSC movements (cycling jogging) all or most of the work is directly converted to external work In these cases there is no need for a compliant tendon since the amount of energy absorption remains low Cycling doesn't rely on stretch-shortening cycles for producing power and but rather requires a steady supply of power Having a more compliant muscle-tendon complex would just mean your muscle has to shorten more to take up all the 'slack' in the muscle before supplying the same amount of power In general your body adapts itself to the workouts you do so if you get 'short' muscles that's because you use them that way If you want to change the length change your bike settings instead and you'll start using them differently as well So your right it's most likely better to do a good warming up than to stretch Reference Stretching and injury prevention An obscure relationship Witvrouw E; Mahieu N; Danneels L; McNair P Sports Med 2004; 34(7) 443-449

2666,fitness,High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) would be a good type of exercise to do Workouts are usually short and aimed at burning fat An example would be running for a minute followed by sprinting for 30 seconds followed by running for a minute etc Another example is running at an incline for a couple minutes followed by level running If your treadmill can simulate a natural running course with hills and valleys that would have a similar effect Here are a couple websites that explain the details Treadmill Workouts Using High Intensity Intervals - HIIT How I Do HIIT on a Treadmill High Intensity Interval Training

2669,fitness,I stumbled on this article Reliability and validity of bioelectrical impedance in determining body composition They tested how reliable the bioelectrical impedance method (BIA) is compared to the golden standards They found The cross-validation correlations for the BIA determinations of % fat ranged from 0 71 to 0 76 which were significantly lower than that obtained with the sum of seven (sigma 7) skinfolds equations (rxy = 0 92 for men and 0 88 for women) The correlations between the weight-to-height ratio body mass index (BMI) and hydrostatically determined % fat were 0 75 and 0 74 for men and women respectively The standard errors of estimate for the two BIA models ranged from 4 6 to 6 4% fat compared with 2 6 and 3 6% fat for the sigma 7 equations The BIA method for measuring body composition was comparable to the BMI method with height and weight accounting for most of the variance in the BIA equation Ironically that would indicate that your BMI is about as accurate as using one of these fancy impedance meters For those interested here's another study by Girandola and Contarsy that found correlations of about 0 76 They conclude The results of the present study support the use of this bioelectrical impedance technique as simple reliable and yet accurate method of assessing the percent of body fat in males and female in the clinical setting I guess it's a matter of opinions but I would recommend a weight scale with a built in impedance meter at least you'll get your weight from it
2681,fitness,In my experience the most detrimental aspect of smoking while bodybuilding is the lack of energy When I smoked I was quite lethargic most of the time and in gym I used to just quit whenever it got too hard or took too much energy Since I didn't feel fresh or rejuvinated even after a good nights sleep going to the gym was usually out of the question because I just didn't feel like it From a medical standpoint probably the most detrimental aspect of smoking is lack of oxygen Whilst smoking the oxygen intake is lessened and it is replaced by various other elements usually ones bad for the body Also the toxins that the cigarettes contain may lead to various diseases in which case doing serious weight training is probably out of the question Standard Disclaimer I am not a doctor so anything I say should not be considered an advice to bet your health on

2677,fitness,IF the sessions you mention are done every day then the answer probably is that you have too little rest Muscle needs rest to be able to recuperate and grow Usually muscle won't grow properly if you do the same muscle group exercises 2 days in a row but twice a day could actually diminish your muscle mass more than they grow Therefore You should try giving your muscles some time to recuperate probably at least a day before another hard workout for that particular muscle group As for the legs I don't see any lower body exercises on the list Sure the amount of cardio you are doing is great for the overall body fat level to drop but is not enough for your legs It may be the case that there is actually quite little fat on your buttocks and legs but it just looks a lot because of lack of muscle Either case you should introduce some lower body exercises in your training programm At least some squats and deadlifts They should be the bare minimum to start growing your lower body
2678,fitness,On the surface (by nutrient breakdown) they look pretty similar except that a sweet potato has massively more vitamin A According to Dr Mirkin 7-ounce white potato with skin 220 calories 5g protein 51g carbs 20mg calcium 115mg phosphorus 2 8mg iron 16mg sodium 844mg potassium 4g fiber 22mg thiamin 07mg riboflavin 3 3mg niacin 16mg vitamin C 7-ounce sweet potato 208 calories 3 5g protein 49g carbs 56mg calcium 110mg phosphorus 1mg iron 20mg sodium 693mg potassium 5g fiber 4350 RE vitamin A 14mg thiamin 13mg riboflavin 1 2mg niacin 49mg vitamin C One difference not captured in that breakdown is that the glycemic index is quite different at 85 (high) for white potato and 54 (medium) for sweet potato
2687,fitness,This depends on the quality of the material and even within shoes from the same factory there can be quite some variation In this study Heel-shoe interactions and the durability of EVA foam running-shoe midsoles by Verdejo and Mills from 2004 they found that after 500 km the peak plantar pressures had increased by 100% on average Furthermore they did electron microscopy scans that showed structural damage in the foam after 750 km Since fatigue of the foam reduces heelstrike cushioning it might cause running injuries You can recognize the damage somewhat by the wrinkles that arise on the side of the heel If you wear the shoes for much longer you sometimes can feel it getting 'softer' when you try to squeeze it Another indication is that the outer layer of your sole is sanded away If this is quite dramatic you might start to get a misalignment of the loads Small note the material is sanded away because you load it like that so it's not necessarily a bad thing And off course if you start to see holes in the upper of the shoe it probably means other parts (invisible) are worse off My advise bad running shoes are a major cause of injuries You've been conditioned to let the shoes aid you in the shock absorption and rolling off If the shoes stop doing this you don't magically alter your running style So don't keep running for too long or start to learn to run better
2704,fitness,I'm not a big fan of LONG cardio workouts I don't see (or heard of) any good/long term benefit to them I would recommend trying something different like Tabata (http //gymboss com/tabata php) interval training It's shorter (16 to 20 minutes) very effective (best personal improvements I've ever seen) and doesn't require any special equipment (so you can do it at home)
2714,fitness,You can take all of the listed various vitamins and supplements together If you're only going to take them once a day it is more beneficial to take them with your largest meal of the day and that hopefully being dinner rather than with breakfast ( Source ) ( Source ) However it is better to take smaller amounts with each meal than to take a single large dose once a day if at all possible This way your body will maintain a more constant and stable supply of it's needed vitamins and nutrients You need to remember that some vitamins are fat-soluble (dissolve in fat) and some vitamins are water-soluble (dissolve in water) If you have a low-fat meal with your multivitamins you're going to miss out on all the fat-soluble vitamins and only absorb the water-soluble ones The reason you're suggested to take your vitamins at your largest meal if you can't take them in multiple phases is because your largest meal is the most likely to be well-rounded for more full absorption of the vitamins

2719,fitness,If you have man-boobs the only practical cure is to lose weight Your only other option is plastic surgery When starting weight loss you need to remember that the body will remove fat from wherever it wants to and you may drop pant sizes before you see a noticeable decrease in fat where you want to see it Doing exercises like butterflies and bench press will (for lack of a better term) make your chest perkier It will build a larger concentration of muscle under the upper part of the fat causing a lifting effect so they won't be as saggy but it won't reduce their size at all Just stick with a diet and fitness program and the problem will resolve itself soon enough And if you do bench press and stuff once they're gone you'll just have nice pecs to flex and show off for the ladies so go ahead and work out whatever you want or need to work out to get a nicely rounded full-body exercise
2724,fitness,According to the 2007 study Effects of Dietary Lactose on Long-term High-fat-diet-induced Obesity in Rats the addition of lactose to a high-fat diet decreased body weight body weight gain fat accumulation and the level of serum leptin In the study four groups were observed over 84 days A control diet group (Cont) a lactose diet group (Lac) in which corn starch in the control diet was replaced by lactose at 10% of the diet weight a high-fat diet group (Fat) in which lard was added to the control diet to adjust the lipid energy ratio to 40% and a lactose-added high-fat diet group (Fat+Lac) in which 10% lactose was added to the high-fat diet The graphs below compares the weight of fats and the amount of serum leptin (a hormone that regulates long-term appetite) between the four groups at the end of the observation The graphs show there is no significant difference between the fat accumulation and serum leptin levels between the Cont and Lac group but the Fat+Lac group does have decreased fat accumulation and serum leptin from the Fat group

2732,fitness,I think the main reason you're not getting the results your looking for is you're working out too often Unless you take illegal and questionable supplements your body is not going to have time to recover and the result is that you're actually breaking down muscle tissue instead of building it up You also don't want to exercise for more than 30-45 minutes at a time because it increases cortisol hormone which is catabolic If you want to increase muscle you want a high level of anabolic hormones (like testosterone) and a low level of catabolic hormones (like cortisol or adrenaline) Remember that it's not the weight lifting itself that builds muscle tissue It's the hormonal changes induced by the weight lifting the resting time in between lifting and the food that you eat that builds muscle Given that weight lifting is actually catabolic in nature and breaks down muscle tissue you want to find the perfect sweet spot of lifting just enough to induce a hormonal change while minimizing how much muscle is broken down This should form the scientific basis on selecting a training program There are widely different opinions on exactly where this sweet spot is and depending on genetics and whether supplements are used this sweet spot will be different for you compared to others The best way to find your sweet spot is to track progress by using an exercise log and a measuring tape (MyoTape is good as you can use it with one hand) You want to increase weight or time under load (this is a more accurate measurement than number of repetitions) almost continuously If you stop progressing for several weeks you're either not getting enough rest (add more rest) not enough food (eat more) or your body has adapted to your current routine (find a new routine) There are also other factors that can change your hormonal balance such as too much alcohol or smoking (can decrease testosterone) or too much stress or too little sleep (increases cortisol) I've studied various weight lifting workout strategies lately and the approach that seems to be based on the most recent research is the high intensity training (also called HIT ) approach outlined in for example Body by Science It recommends one workout per week of extremely high intensity I am personally doing a split version of that program roughly twice a week I combine this with low level cardio (brisk walking) for about 5 hours per week and about 1 high intensity interval training session per week (5 minutes of tabata interval sprints at 90-95% heart rate maximum) I've been doing this routine for about 2 months and almost doubled my 7 repetition maximum Before that I've done several years of more traditional weight lifting of medium intensity several times a week with only moderate gains I've plateaued the last 2 weeks though so I might swap things around a little bit but I will probably stick to a high intensity/low frequency approach Nutrition is also important but that is a different topic

2802,fitness,Yes -- my suggestion is that you need to see a doctor and get a diagnosis When you say jammed my shoulder that could mean any number of injuries For example I have had shoulder pain in my left shoulder when raising my left arm outwards for about three months I waited about a month for it to get better and finally saw a doctor When I saw my doctor he had me perform a number of different movements while providing resistance with his hands He diagnosed me with something called sub-acromial bursitis This is an inflammation of a fluid filled sack (a bursa) in the shoulder joint I have been seeing a physical therapist for about six weeks once a week and performing exercises at home every other day The physical therapist leads me through specific exercises and also treats the area with ultrasound The discomfort and pain is very slowly improving I am also taking Aleve (Naproxen) to help reduce the inflammation Depending on your shoulder injury you may need physical therapy corticosteroid injections surgery or other treatment Only a doctor can determine this for sure My experience has been that shoulder injuries take a long time to heal

2764,fitness,The kidneys of a healthy person can process about 15 liters of water a day - well beyond your current intake The only caveat is that you can't drink it all at once If you space your water consumption over a long enough time then it's very difficult to induce water intoxication If you were to drink your normal 5 liters in the span of an hour say you will start to get hyponatremia which is the dilution of salt in the body When that happens you will start to see symptoms similar to being drunk - confusion lack of balance etc If that occurs it's a serious medical condition that could result in your death I drink about a gallon or more of water a day and have been doing so for several years The amount isn't as important as how long it takes you
2781,fitness,There is no scientific evidence that these gels work From a site reviewing a Hoodia weight loss gel There is not much actual evidence that the Hoodia Slender Gel actually works However there seems to be quite a bit of sales copy pointing to the fact that this product may be the very best lowest priced most successful and the strongest However not much evidence is offered to this fact The hugest problem is that there is not yet much evidence that that hoodia Functions trans-dermally (meaning that it absorbs through the skin) So save your funds for any Hoodia solution that is established to assist suppress your appetite and shed pounds Don’t waste it on fad items It is possible that Slender Gel could be one of those fad items ( Source ) From the Shiseido site on the Body Creator Abdomen Toning Gel if you check the Technology tab you'll find a lot of fluff and an extremely short list of ingredients Contains Caffeine Houttuynia Cordata Extract Red Pepper Extract and Menthol [ ] ( Source ) Caffeine as we all know is a stimulant Caffeine is absorbed through the skin ( Source ) Houttuynia Cordata Extract is an anti-inflammatory ( Source ) It is also an anti-oxidant ( Source ) Red Peppers are also an anti-oxidant and also have anti-bacterial properties ( Source ) Menthol has a wide variety of useful properties most affecting the skin (anti-inflammatory anesthetic etc) but also has a few others including decongestant strengthening the heart muscles reducing muscle and joint inflammation It has many other uses but none are associated with weight loss ( Source ) While it is possible that the caffeine in the gel may be able to carry a portion of the houttuynia cordata and red peppers through the skin and into the subcutaneous layer those elements will effectively be absorbed into the bloodstream and carried and spread throughout the body The same is true of liquid nicotine if you spill it on your leg (in sufficient quantity) it will kill you Certainly it absorbs locally but it doesn't make your leg fall off Such items as the red pepper and the menthol will be more noticeable at the localized area because of their extreme effects on the nerve endings and their diminished effects as they are spread thinner through the bloodstream My advice would be to test this in theory if you really want to see if it works Simple method take yesterday's coffee that was left on the burner overnight mix it into some menthol rub add some finely ground red peppers (they will extract into the caffeine/menthol suspension) and you'll have to buy some houttu
2776,fitness,This is absolutely a good approach You get to build up some muscle and you don't damage your metabolism the way you would with severe calorie restriction I think it is worth doing a little myth-busting A pound of muscle will burn more calories per day but only about 6 more calories and you'll likely eat a little more to compensate However the correlation to fat loss is very real which I think debunks the oft-quoted but over-simplified calories in minus calories out approach and a couple possible explanations are A larger percentage of food eaten goes to repairing and further building your muscles and other supporting systems such as skeletal and even cardiovascular instead of being stored as excess energy (fat) Extra muscle and in particular the process of building extra muscle tends to put the body into a favorable hormonal state for fat loss
2943,fitness,I know you already accepted the answer on this one but hopefully I can clarify things (if not for you for someone else) Rippetoe is trying to describe where your eyes should be looking and that the eyes should not follow the bar Essentially you are staring at the same point on the ceiling throughout the set When unracking the bar the bar will be above your eyes possibly a little more toward your hair side With arms fully locked move the bar to it's up position without changing your gaze When the bar is in the up position it will be in your field of view closer to your feet (foot side) It will not be directly above your eyes Don't shift your gaze but see it Each rep the goal is to put the bar in the same place every rep Bring the bar down to your sternum and lift back to the same position in your field of view each time All of this is much clearer in the Starting Strength book If you are serious about lifting weights I highly recommend buying the book It is well worth it
2790,fitness,Here's an excerpt from a blog post I did a while back addressing this question The “plug” in the bottom of your stomach is a stoma not a valve It can be pushed open so when you drink during a meal the liquid can push the food out of your stomach pouch and down into your intestines There are two reasons you should care This frees up extra room in your stomach pouch so you’ll eat more during that meal You’ll feel hungry again sooner A recommendation that I’ve stumbled across is the 15/30 rule Don’t drink anything from 15 minutes before a meal until 30 minutes after a meal This isn’t a license to under-hydrate just a guideline on when to drink Update The comment thread has indicated a desire for proof (pedants -) ) so here is some reference information and some reasoning built on top of that in support of the above hypothesis First the amount of fluid in the stomach is positively correlated with the rate of gastric emptying It so happens that 30 minutes is an approximate inflection point in the gastric emptying of both a solid and liquid meal per the chart below (same source) I'll assert that drinking water will render the net contents of the stomach more fluid moving the gastric emptying rate from the blue curve towards the red curve This seems to confirm the conclusion that avoiding liquid during the meal will help stave off the next bout of hunger because a more solid meal will take longer to empty The 15 minutes before also seems to fit as roughly half of liquid consumed 15 minutes beforehand will have been emptied before the meal starts If one further considers the dynamics drinking water immediately before a meal will help fill up the stomach and reduce immediate hunger but will cause that meal to be digested faster so I hypothesize that you will be hungrier sooner with this approach
2907,fitness,According to research ( Source ) the body only needs 0 36g of protein per pound each day for maintenance In 2009 the American Dietetic Association Dietitians of Canada and the American College of Sports Medicine released an abstract supporting 0 5g to 0 8g of protein per pound each day as sufficient ( Source ) You can take in a significant amount more than this and be fine as excess protein is excreted so long as you get enough fats and/or carbohydrates as well to balance your nutrition needs and solubilize your fat-soluble vitamins that your body requires as well as calcium to replace that which the protein will leech from your system ( Source ) You must consume enough water to flush the excess There's not any point in buying extra protein though if you already have plenty in your diet to start with Those doing body-building will need to be on the high end of this scale Based on those research articles at 250 pounds the figures are as follows 0 4g/lb = 100g/day (sedentary) 0 5g/lb = 125g/day 0 6g/lb = 150g/day (active) 0 7g/lb = 175g/day 0 8g/lb = 200g/day (body-building) Regardless of the amount of calories in your diet your necessary protein will fall into that range of amounts Anything over that amount will be flushed from the body If you eat more food you won't need to also add more protein The amounts listed above are sufficient If you eat less food you won't need to drop protein Just stay within that range If you're cutting pounds but not doing any serious weight training you're going to fall somewhere between 0 4g and 0 6g of protein per pound If you want to take more than that as long as you're taking in enough fiber you won't see much in digestive problems taking in enough calcium will prevent bone density problems and taking in enough water will prevent kidney problems
2797,fitness,The Simple BMI is the one which doesn't take the ratio of lean to fat mass into consideration If you are athletic or muscular it has less value than if you are not Obese means you are carrying an unhealthy amount of weight as fat So a true measure would have to include body fat % The reason the Simple BMI exists is it is good as a general measure When I weighed nearly 300 lbs I would frequently remark that BMI was meaningless without fat % consideration However I acknowledged that it was probably closer to accurate for me than it would be if I was heavily muscled and athletic There are BMI calculations that take body fat % into account but to make use of them you need some way to reliably measure your body fat% There are many methods but discussing them is out of scope for this question ASIDE For the record I'm an endurance athlete now I'm 6'2 and weigh 175 lbs with a body fat % hovering around 10% You do not offend me but I am not too small by any stretch I wear size small mens t-shirts but I get funny looks when I say so because I have a long torso and am fairly broad chested I will acknowledge that I'm not particularly muscular above the waist
2942,fitness,Clap push-ups In this exercise you assume the push-up position then performs a push-up in an explosive manner launching your upper body off the ground to a height where the participant has time to clap their hands together then place their hands back on the ground in the original start position In this exercise the participant continues to perform repetitions until there is a loss in technique Power push-ups from a kneeling position In this exercise the participant kneels on the ground with their body vertical and their spine in the neutral position the participant then falls forwards (keeping the spine in the neutral position) placing their hands on the ground in the push-up position then explosively performs a push-up pushing their body back to the original start position In this exercise the participant keeps performing repetitions until the participant can no longer push themselves back to the start position or until there is a loss in technique Bench-Press throw In this exercise the participant sets up a Smith-Machine as if to do a regular Bench-Press the participant then unlocks the bar and lowers the bar to the chest at a rapid pace then explosively pushes the bar into the air (and out of the hands) attempting to achieve as much height with the bar as possible then catching the bar Increasing the weight of the bar will result in a loss of speed and height each time you increase the weight of the bar your 2 main objectives will be to work on the speed component and work towards achieving the same height reached with the previous lighter weight If the weight is too heavy there will be a noticeable loss in speed height and technique Horizontal push-press In this exercise the participant holds a BB at chest height while standing in a shoulder-width stance 1) The participant then explosively drives the BB horizontally while at the same time driving the left foot forwards and the right foot backwards into a fighting stance 2) The participant then explosively pulls the bar back into the chest while at the same time explosively returning the feet to a shoulder-width stance 3) The participant again explosively drives the bar horizontally this time the right foot is driven forwards and the left foot is driven backwards into a fighting stance 4) This sequence is repeated again and again In this exercise the participant either works for maximal reps (power endurance) stopping when there is a loss in technique or works towards a set rep range Increasing the weight of the BB will result in a loss in speed the participant will also find it harder to be able to continually keep the bar at chest height as gravity is constantly pulling the bar in a downwards direction Each time you increase the weight of the BB your objective will be to work on the speed component while keeping immaculate technique if the additional weight is too heavy there will be a noticeable loss in speed and technique Measuring your power out put Throwing a shot put in the same manner in which you would throw a punch is a great means to measure your punching power if the distance that you are throwing the shot put is increasing and you are still able to hold good form then your punching power must also be increasing Throwing a shot put in the same manner in which you would throw a punch is also a great exercise to develop your maximal power in the same manner you would use a 1RM in the gym for strength training In this exercise the participant adopts an orthodox-fighting stance and holds
2806,fitness,The Wikipedia article about Running states A cold bath is a popular treatment of subacute injuries or inflammation muscular strains and overall muscular soreness but its efficacy is controversial [14] Some claim that for runners in particular ice baths offer two distinct improvements over traditional techniques First immersion allows controlled even constriction around all muscles effectively closing microscopic damage that cannot be felt and numbing the pain that can One may step into the tub to relieve sore calves quads hams and connective tissues from hips to toes will gain the same benefits making hydrotherapy an attractive preventive regimen The second advantage involves a physiological reaction provoked by the large amount of muscle submerged Assuming one has overcome the mind's initial flight response in those first torturous minutes the body fights back by invoking a blood rush This rapid transmission circulation flushes the damage-inflicting waste from the system while the cold water on the outside preserves contraction Reference [14] is a decent About com review However a study by Sellwood et al Ice-water immersion and delayed-onset muscle soreness a randomised controlled trial found no significant changes in pain parameters tenderness isometric strength swelling hop-for-distance or serum creatine kinase (CK) over time But Vaile et al found in their study Effect of hydrotherapy on recovery from fatigue that Sprint (0 1 - 2 2 %) and a total of 9-min sustained effort (time trial - TT) (0 0 - 1 7 %) performance were enhanced across the five-day trial following cold water immersion (CWI) and contrast water therapy (CWT) when compared to hot water immersion (HWI) and passive recovery (PAS) I would therefore hypothesize that the effect of a cold water bath may depend on the type of workout and the intensity thereof Given that you're a sprinter perhaps it can be beneficial when you've done a high intensity workout where you are more likely to have microscopic damage than during an endurance training But then again that's just my hypothesis
2815,fitness,Probably not Training for powerlifting (completely strength-oriented) involves avoiding failure keeping the number of reps low and resting a lot between sets none of which are really conducive to burn during a workout or soreness afterwards Pavel Tsatsouline gave this answer to a similar question during an interview One thing is for sure you can’t use soreness as an indicator of progress The only meaningful gauge is the increase in your strength or your muscle mass Soreness doesn’t mean a thing And on the likelihood of soreness from powerlifting-style training If they go to low rep heavy non-exhaustive training — three sets of three or five sets of five — they would not get sore

2838,fitness,Losing weight is more about burning calories than using different muscles Running has several advantages it's weight bearing so you are your own workout tool The harder you run the more energy it will require running uses more than just the legs because you have to stabilize your torso against the swings of your legs This trains your abdomen and uses the arms everybody knows how to run because it's just a faster way of walking Not everyone knows how to properly lift weights or perform other workouts (without training) running is easy to maintain for long stretches of time when done at a moderate speed yet burns a lot of calories in the process This is excellent for burning fat running has a very constant rate of burning calories whereas most other exercises like lifting weights often consist of bursts of high intensity workouts The high intensity means you're burning more glycogen rather than fat compared to during a moderate running workout even though you can feel exhausted after both So no you don't have to do anything else but running however if you want to loose more weight run more Be careful for working out too often too hard or too long it might get you injured Instead focus on building up a better fitness and in a couple of months you'll be able to run longer and more often that's when you really start to loose weight So just be patient
2897,fitness,The majority of studies show that squatting just below parallel is perfectly safe and in fact even beneficial to the knee However there is a difference between just breaking parallel and squatting until your hamstrings hit your calves (ATG) My personal opinion is that even ATG squatting is safe for the knees and studies of weightlifters - who squat as deep as humanly possible - generally confirm this However there are some studies that show increased risk of knee injury from very deep squatting Even more importantly the benefits from going ATG vs just below parallel aren't huge for most goals/activities and not many people have the flexibility to do so while maintaining a proper lumbar arch Therefore while I'd always recommend squatting below parallel I'd only suggest ATG squatting if your goals directly benefit from it with olympic weight lifting being the primary use case For your reading pleasure exrx - Squat Analysis Deconstructing The Squat Part I Are Deep Squats Bad for Your Knees Injury rates and profiles of elite competitive weightlifters Knee biomechanics of the dynamic squat exercise
2845,fitness,Toning exercises are done to teach the body to more efficiently conserve it's resources (such as oxygen) and to build endurance Doing that many reps with that light of weights is likely not achieving much of an effect at all Your muscles are developed by use and that easy of an exercise relates closer to cardio than to a true workout Simply put there are two types of muscle tone myogenic and neurogenic The former refers to your muscle tone at rest; the latter refers to muscle tone that's expressed when muscular contractions occur Low(er) rep training increases the sensitivity of various motor units resulting in increased neurogenic tone On the other hand myogenic tone is correlated with the overall density of your muscles (specifically the contractile proteins myosin and actin) and is vastly improved by lifting heavier weights ( Source ) So yes you can do more reps with lighter weights to make your muscles look better in a relaxed state and less reps with heavier weights to make them look better in a contracted state As a general rule I've always been told to use the maximum weight you can do 12 reps with for toning and the maximum weight you can do 7 reps with for building The same article I've quoted there also says utilizing light weights (anything above twelve reps in my book) while dieting will likely result in loss of muscle which is the exact opposite of what you want to happen
2861,fitness,You are probably lowering the barbell too high up your chest which causes your elbows to flare out Try moving the barbell lower down your chest on the way down so you can keep your elbows more tucked in (perhaps &lt; 45 degrees to your body instead of 90) This will make sure the bench press is a chest and arm workout and not a dangerous shoulder workout Obviously its impossible to know if you are doing this without seeing your technique try an empty barbell at the gym next time and get someone to watch your elbow position
2850,fitness,Idealy you would do the workout all at once and then spread out your cardio if you enjoy going more than once a day The problem with doing the scenario you describe is that depending on the intensity of the workout in the morning you may be over doing it at night before your body has a chance to repair This is especially true if your second workout is heavily using the muscles you already damaged earlier in the day While your muscles may have recovered enough to 'do' the exercises you might end up over-working them to the point of ineffectiveness However if your schedule only leaves you with a few days a week to work out and you want to cover more specific workouts you can try to pair up antagonist/unused muscle groups in the morning/night For instance you could do a Back workout in the morning and instead of doing the common pairing of Back and Biceps (I don't know about you but my Biceps are quite well used after a Back workout ) you could do Triceps If you want to get even more specific in your workouts you could pair true antagonist muscle groups (using their full names) into splitting up workouts into morning and night Pectorals/latissimus dorsi (pecs and lats) Anterior deltoids/posterior deltoids (front and back shoulder) Trapezius/deltoids (traps and delts) Abdominals/spinal erectors (abs and lower-back caution here do abs first ) Left and right external obliques (sides) Quadriceps/hamstrings (quads and hams) Shins/calves Biceps/triceps Forearm flexors/extensors
2856,fitness,You need to do enough exercise to burn more calories than you consume in a day For every 3500 calorie deficit you'll lose approximately a pound The more strenuous your exercise is the more calories you'll burn and the longer your excess post oxygen consumption phase will last Anywhere from 30 minutes to about an hour and a half is considered healthy as long as you aren't overworking yourself by doing this routine more than every other day Just remember fat loss has very little to do with exercise it's simple mathematics of calories in/calories out If you eat more calories than you burn they get stored as fat for later If you consume 5000 calories a day and burn 3000 with lots of exercise you'll still put on a 2 pounds every 3 5 days If you are eating a proper healthy diet you should be able to healthily lose 2-4 pounds each week Considering that with exercise one will doubtfully burn more than 3000 calories in a day so on a 2000 calorie diet burning 3000 calories you'll lose 2 pounds a week
2937,fitness,I also have Erb's Palsey in my left shoulder/neck I am now almost 20 and I have had therapy and tests done up until I was 12 when I moved away from my therapist I never was able to continue occupational therapy Some of the things that helped me the most were wall push-ups and a thing called 'superman' which you lay on your stomach put your arms as straight out in front of you as possible and lay your legs straight behind you In order to do one set you lift your legs off the ground about 4-8 inches and lift arms about 5 inches off the floor in front of you all at the same time Then after holding that position for 15 seconds go back to the resting position This should work mainly your back/shoulder muscles your abs and stretch the muscles that get tight when our Erb's palsey is being 'difficult ' This is a great exercise for many of the muscles that are hard to target and when doing it you should work your way up slowly and make sure you are ready to go for longer so that you don't stress those muscles too much If you are not safe about things like that it can have a reverse reaction where you get hurt not better I hope that I helped some Have a great day -Whit
2871,fitness,The core as it is referred to consists of the muscles of your torso such as your pecs lats psoas abs traps obliques etc When you are asked to engage these muscles this means utilizing them for stability and smooth motion Rather than just flinging yourself wildly and letting the forces of nature work on you (centrifugal force gravity etc) you need to engage your core to produce smooth stable movements Think of raising your arms above your head and lowering them back to your sides You have to use your traps to raise the arms but you can just let gravity take over to lower them and let them flop back to your sides To get the full benefit though you would want to raise your arms slowly engaging muscles to fight against the raising of your arms although not to make it impossible to raise them Lowering them you would want to utilize muscles to lower them and also fight against the lowering at the same time This engagement works two or more sets of muscles simultaneously and if you follow the directions you have taking this sort of fight into account you'll get a much more well-rounded and beneficial workout
2870,fitness,There is no best exercise to lose belly fat In fact there is no exercise that will specifically target weight loss in any part of your body The only way to lose fat in your belly is to lose fat overall The number one thing you can do to lose weight is look at your diet Losing weight is as simple as burning more calories than you consume The easiest way to reduce your caloric intake is to eat healthier foods Food you buy at the grocery store and cook yourself are often healthier than what you would get at a fast food joint because they haven't been processed as much For many people cutting out most of the sugar in their diet (obviously not sugar from fruit and other healthy sources) is an excellent way to lose the weight It's good that you split your 3 big meals into 5 smaller ones but make sure your 5-meal calorie count is really less than your 3-meal plan Once you get your diet squared away then you will really start to see the benefits of your exercising I would suggest doing a lot of different exercises in the beginning and there are many to try Figure out what you like to do and works best for you Is there anybody you could work out with A partner is always a big plus to exercise Remember it took you 10 years to gain the little extra weight you have right now A healthy weight loss routine would have you losing a maximum of 2 pounds per week on average If you want to get down to 190 again you're looking at around a year or more of a dedicated lifestyle change in order to accomplish that
2890,fitness,In general training while sore is perfectly fine and usually beneficial subject to a few caveats discussed below Almost every serious athlete frequently trains while still a bit sore from the previous workout Image from the wikipedia article The first thing to understand is supercompensation a short while after training your muscles end up a bit stronger If you train again during this period your next supercompensation period will be slightly stronger again Repeat this cycle with proper timing over and over again and you'll gain strength in the most efficient way possible Wait too long and the muscle returns back to a normal state and strength gains are slowed The second thing to understand is that soreness has nothing to do with the effectiveness of your workout It's more of a side effect which is actually not well understood Depending on your training level and workouts you may still be sore even when your muscles are in the supercompensation period If this happens you just need to put up with it and train sufficiently hard to keep the gains coming BTW this is also a reason why split routines - where you train each muscle once a week - are very inefficient for the vast majority of beginner &amp; intermediate lifters Your muscles hit the supercompensation period in far less than a week and have started to return to normal by the time you train again In this respect fully body routines 2-3 times per week are going to produce strength gains much faster Some caveats if you are sore to the point that it interferes with the workout (ie you can't do the motion correctly) then you won't gain much from exercise and are better off resting A rule of thumb to determine this is to do a thorough warm-up if everything loosens up and you feel ok train on If you are still stiff and it hurts to move rest If you are new to a certain type of exercise soreness levels will be much higher so the first few weeks may require skipping more workouts than normal (don't make it a habit though) Finally more advanced lifters who are moving a lot of weight will take longer to recover which will impact things like workout frequency and volume
2881,fitness,Squats are probably the most common and are a very effective leg exercise There are a lot more options that are available to you depending on your weight set and any available equipment For a good increase in raw leg strength you can also do Chair Jumps Get a (solid stable) chair and standing 6 away from it jump up onto it and back down This doesn't require any weights at all and is incredibly effective at working nearly every muscle in your legs
2884,fitness,Creatine and L-Glutamine seem like good choices L-Glutamine may already be included in your BCAA mix Both are good for recovery and growth; creatine also provides extra easily-accessible fuel to your muscles during a lift so that you can get that extra rep cranked out Do avoid taking creatine and L-Glutamine at the same time as they can compete for receptors to be absorbed in the body I tend to take L-Glutamine about an hour before working out and creatine immediately afterward (Also creatine first thing in the morning and L-Glutamine last thing at night before bed) Update per this question it seems that there may not in fact be competition between these two supplements so they could be taken together
2889,fitness,The basic principles behind the ShakeWeight appear to be somewhat sound however the research displayed in their advertising is (likely intentionally) misleading Their advertising states that a minute of exercise with the ShakeWeight is equivalent to 42 minutes of exericise with dumbells What you don't see (or most people don't see) is the little print at the bottom that says that the study was done with the same weight in dumbbells as what the ShakeWeight weighs For the men's version this is 5 pounds and for the women's version is only 2 5 pounds I've never seen a man working out with only 5 pound dumbbells personally Additionally the ShakeWeight does not allow for a full range of motion exercise routine which will seriously limit the effectiveness of your muscles outside of the range in which they are being worked and could be seriously detrimental to future workout efforts not involving the ShakeWeight As far as can you look like that guy no The ShakeWeight is only designed to work your shoulders (deltoid and trapezius) arms (bicep tricep and forearms) chest (pecs) and upper back (lats and traps) It will not work your legs lower back abs etc You will still be required to work those muscles separately if you want to look like the guy in the commercials I'm fairly certain that you can use the ShakeWeight to go a certain distance in training the muscles I mentioned before but scalability is going to eventually catch up to you and likely quite quickly if you are really trying to build Since you cannot increase the weight you can only go faster to get more of a workout There will come a point where you can't go faster and the device will be too light At that point the device will become useless and if you hope or plan to maintain any gains you have made or advance further then you'll need to be prepared to devote some time to a normal workout routine However due to the lack of a full range of motion exercise you'll be far more prone to injury when switching to standard weights My advice Don't work out with it
2898,fitness,I find it highly unlikely that you would burn more calories on an eliptical trainer than running at a similar pace on the treadmill The treadmill is more like using free weights whereas the elliptical trainer just needs a push in somewhat the right direction to keep going round Also pushing with one leg automatically moves the other which is almost like a free lunch Basically all the things that make it great are also what make it bad Yes it has lower impacts on the knees but that also means your knee extending muscles are trained less Yes using your arms increases the intensity of the workout but because the arms drive the legs that's all energy your legs aren't going to provide You win some you loose some Also the enforced stride length may not be the right one for you depending on your size and physical condition Running at a different frequency effects the efficiency and intensity of the workout as well And lastly the resistance on an elliptical trainer comes from a fly wheel that requires air resistance As I explained on another question this doesn't scale very naturally So to workout at 75-80% of your maximal heart rate which is probably what you would need for ~700 calories/30 minutes you'd have either a ridiculous frequency or abnormal high resistance As for finding out the truth I highly recommend you try all the devices with the same heart rate monitor rather than trusting the built in one That way you can compare the increases in heart rate when you increase the resistance of the machine in three/four steps Do that for the elliptical trainer bike and treadmill and you get a much better idea of whether it actually measures correctly Final note it's more important you do something that's fun so if the elliptical trainer makes you come back more often than go for it Also there's a study that showed that elliptical trainers can be a great replacement during the winter times but they had to workout at 80% of their maximal heart rate which was comparable to the intensity of their normal running exercise and the runners complained it was hard to keep this up Either way 3x more calories than on a treadmill is absolutely not possible
2900,fitness,There's a Wikipedia article about Exercise-induced nausea where they suggest two possible causes endorphins and too much water There has also been a study that showed that exercising shortly after eating is likely to cause this Which is supported by this article about Nausea during a strength training workout that suggests three common factors that contribute to workout nausea Too much food or water in the stomach which is likely the case just after eating or drinking too much water (see above) High or maximum heart rate and uncontrolled breathing which elevates the blood pressure to heights that can give a 'sick to the stomach' feeling Bending over during a period of maximum heart rate while inhaling This messes with the muscle that closes off the top of the stomach and fails under such strains They also provide several tips to prevent it Get enough rest between sets with very high heart rates Don't bend over to adjust the weights this avoids compressing the stomach Drink the bare minimum amount of water that you feel you need (not too much but also not too little) Don't drink carbonated drinks Furthermore resist the urge to gulp water when you're thirsty Drink the water in sips and pause for a moment to let your body absorb The thirst satisfaction of your brain doesn't respond instantaneously Getting more exercised or in better shape won't help because you'll always have a maximum and if you push for it you'll reach it
2905,fitness,I have three things that I changed about my diet when I started training in martial arts Drink more water I drink a gallon a day You'd be surprised how much you sweat while working out Have you ever weighed yourself before and after a heavy leg day for example Take a fish oil or other omega-3 fatty acid supplement Once you get into training kicking and punching in earnest your knees and elbows may start to ache I found that a daily fish oil dose cured almost all my aches and pains Finally take a multi and lift heavy You said you have a randomly healthy diet already I'm not sure what that means but adding a multi vitamin couldn't hurt This is pretty standard advice for anybody however
2904,fitness,If you're working the same muscles each day you're likely exercising far too much Typically a person should only work a muscle every 2-3 days Check out the chart in this answer to Is it healthy to exercise a muscle when it's still sore and a similar chart as figure 2 in this answer to Importance of Rest Days The optimum time to work a muscle out again is at the peak of it's supercompensation/adaptation Working out more often inhibits any potential gains with fatigue and working out too seldom causes the gains to already be lost by the next workout This is very individualized and you need to find out what works best for your body If you find that you are not progressing though you need to change something up
