2633,I do a fair amount of weightlifting; in particular heavy compound lifts power-lifting style I also compete on a target pistol team Over the years I've heard a number of coaches and marksmen recommend that serious shooters stay away from heavy lifting because it could affect arm stability/precision when holding the pistol The physical requirement for this sport is to be able to hold a 2 lb pistol (with one hand/arm only) at arm's length with elbow locked as steady as possible for 5-10 secs So my question are these two sports at odds Can someone give an explanation for why heavy lifting might (or might not) compromise my ability to hold the pistol as steady as I could if I didn't lift,fitness,2668
2644,Has anyone read Why We Get Fat And What to Do About It Here is the book on amazon His basic argument is this (my words) The author argues that insulin in large part is responsible for regulating how much fat you have the more the insulin the more fat Insulin tells your fat cell to absorb and maintain their supply of fat and not to release it into the blood stream Insulin is produced in response to the presence and amount of blood sugar in your body when you start to eat your blood sugar increases Fructose and carbohydrates rapidly increase your blood sugar levels resulting in a highly elevated level of insulin Eating a lot of fructose and carbohydrates every day will result in a condition known as insulin resistance This will result in your body having an elevated level of insulin at all times making you virtually incapable of using anything but glucose and carbohydrates as energy Because the cells in the rest of your body quickly run out of energy you get hungry faster because you are just coasting off of the carbs from your last meal My question is is Gary Taubes correct,fitness,2945
2647,For most of my life I stretched out before cycling to avoid cramps or pulling a muscle However I discovered last year that I could skip stretching exercises in favor of a slightly extended warm-up period riding gently for about five minutes and avoiding any strenuous climbing Is stretching before non-weight bearing exercise (like cycling) detrimental to performance Can gently stretching a cold muscle harm it Should the intensity of your workout change when (or whether) you stretch out (My knowledge on this is strictly limited to trial and error with my own body and exercise routine so it'd be helpful if answers were non-anecdotal ) Related Will stretching make me slower on Bicycles SE,fitness,2655

2728,When searching for the internet or even talking to trainers you will get an infinite number of routines How should one choose a routine that is best for him Is there any logic about it at all I'm not addressing the exercises themselves but to the general diversion of muscle groups across days of the week It looks like every mix is possible even when I'm looking for the most recommended routines Of course most of the routines don't include any explanation other than you will see the results in X months The only logical thing about routines that I've heard is that it's better to do the Biceps exercises the same day you do the back and Triceps on the shoulders + chest day because the big muscle exercises also effort the according arm-muscle This way you provide full rest for the Biceps/Triceps when it's not their workout day Is this true can I have more examples for this kind of sense in the vague world of routines I'm working out since August and my results are not satisfying enough I'm not looking for reasons of why I didn't grow up the way I wanted but for a fresh routine to become more motivated and consistent It's just so hard to pick one and it seems so consequences-full I'm having 4 workout days a week,fitness,2732
2735,I'm looking for some practical yet tasty solutions for a high protein diet I like food that has intense flavour In a bid for this question not to be closed can you please post a bit of information on the nutrional value of the food For example Egg whites 11g of protein per 100g,fitness,2739
2736,Let's say I'm a little too fat to be doing a real push up Do you recommend me to push up with my knees supporting my body first and then progress further OR Do you think it's better if I start with the less push ups (say 5 10 15 incremental over days) My goals are to increase endurance strengthen my wrists forearms and chest Disclaimer I'm not really fat No offence to any if they sorta are,fitness,2737
2740,I jammed my shoulder a few years ago while catching myself in a skateboard fall and since then it has had issues off and on where during periods where it bothers me I can't do pushups or dumbbell work The injury has been in the aggravated period for the last several months and is showing no signs of getting better It is affecting my workouts at least those involving chest/back/shoulders (i e any exercises that involve pressure on the shoulder) I've seen chiropractors with little success I haven't tried physical therapy and I haven't gone to a specialist through my Primary Care Phsyician Stretching and yoga also not a big help The injury doesn't get worse and doesn't get better Just is there slightly annoying and especially annoying with certain exercises,fitness,2802
2752,When specifying sets and reps like 5x5 3x5 (in general XxY) which is which It seems like it usually means X sets of Y reps but on some forums I see logs that seem to indicate that either they are (a) doing dozens of 1 rep sets (which might be valid) or (b) they are using the notation in the other order (i e X reps done Y times ) Is there a traditional way of reading/writing these,fitness,2759
2756,I'm attempting to understand if I should be using something other than whey (isolate) protein shake after my gym workouts (weight lifting and core strengthening) There are lots of specific products advertised both on TV at the gym and at the supplement store that have names like Bulk or hydroxycut as well as many many more My question is Is the science in on whether these other products have some advantage over just taking a straight 100% protein powder mixed with pure water I'm not an elite bodybuilder just looking to stay fit an healthy and ensure I don't lose any lean muscle mass,fitness,2757
2760,I know that there is the standard 8x8oz glasses or ~ 3 liters of water per day But today I read that since about 75% of muscle is water people using their muscles intensively need more water about two times as much as standard So my question is at which point does more become too much How much water can I drink before I start hurting my kidneys Background I'm currently drinking about 5 liters of water per day if training about 4 if on rest,fitness,2764
2767,Does it make any sense to use caffeine/menthol slendering gels There are many products for women and also some from (I've seen abdomen gel from shiseido) Do such gels work Do you recommend any EDIT What I mean by those gels working is do they really increase fat loss in the areas where you use them,fitness,2781
2771,I heard on a podcast that pounds of fat burn calories at a different rate than pounds of muscle The thinking is that a pound of fat sitting idly over the course of the day requires X calories whereas a pound of muscle sitting idly over the course of the day (that is to say without being vigorously exercised) requires X+Y calories because muscle is more expensive for your body to maintain nutritionally speaking That would seem to imply that if one were to undertake a workout regimen designed to build muscles (lots of strength training minimal focus on cardiovascular activities) that the additional muscle mass would result in the body burning more calories per day while it was in its at rest state That would seem to imply that one would then be able to lose some of their fat weight as they would now have a more favorable ratio of caloric intake to caloric expenditure Is this a healthful approach to weight loss If someone were in a situation where they were overweight (but not yet obese) is strength-training a logical approach to achieving a higher fitness level,fitness,2776
2774,In the link below Mark Rippetoe of Starting Strength says that when positioning oneself for a bench press http //startingstrength wikia com/wiki/FAQ The_Lifts#The_Bench_Press Your eyes should not be gazing directly beneath the bar but rather looking just past the foot side of the bar Any idea what the foot side of the bar is When lying on my back should the bar be right above my eyes,fitness,2943
2784,As the title says I would like to know what is the best time to drink water is it before during or after having a meal Also suppose the answer was during what quantity is recommended,fitness,2790
2792,I'm currently taking in 100 grams a day of protien via whey powder I used to take 250 grams when I was training I've read that you should intake 1 gram per pound of body weight you have when training I've also seen numbers such as between 0 8 and 1 gram of protein per kilogram of weight a day (about 7 grams per 20 pounds So a person who weighs 150 pounds would need around 52 grams a day ) I'm ~250lbs right now I was 260 but I'm cutting wieght to 240 I'm not doing any serious training right now Edit To be clear my question is about how much is too much for the body before seeing side effects such as kidney problems digestion problems etc Not necessarily about wieght loss At my body weight how much is too much,fitness,2907
2796,If you look at charts they will all say that I'm obese or worse I'm 6'1 ~250 (dropping to 240) but I'm not fat These charts seem to base it on the fact that my weight vs my height is not in proportion According to those charts I should be 150-170 (which IMO is far too small Not to offend anyone ) Shouldn't this be based on body fat % instead of weight vs height What body fat % should be considered obese Or is the term obese not meaning fat but weight overall relative to what your heart can handle which would have those charts making more sense,fitness,2797
2799,Since being told that biceps are bad for punching speed I've toned down the amount of pull-ups I do and switched to a wide grip with palms facing away to emphasize the lats more than the biceps Now I'm worried whether lats are also bad for punching speed I've also heard that triceps-training exercises like push-ups are good particularly if you can do them plyometrically (i e with a hop at the top) What other exercises are good or bad for punching and kicking speed Any suggestions would be appreciated though I would prefer exercises that can be done at home (e g calisthenics) I would also accept answers to the slightly different question what muscles are good/bad to train without recommending particular exercises EDIT Thanks for the many responses One thing that would be greatly appreciated are some suggestions of exercises for training kick speed since nobody has commented on that yet EDIT #2 As has been commented below speed and accuracy are more a matter of muscle coordination than muscle strength However I was thinking of starting martial arts classes in the summer so I'm hoping to get exercise tips to better direct my workouts until then,fitness,2942
2805,I am a sprinter around the grand old age of 21 At our track there is a lot of debate of whether cold bath (or ice bath if you're brave enough) aids recovery of the muscle What are your opinions Are there any other post-training techniques that you would recommend Dont think this has to be sport-specific as it will easily go across the board for most sports Stu,fitness,2806

2812,How should I choose a multi-vitamin as a man Should I just try and get the most potency/per dollar product Are there any well known generally accepted superior brands,fitness,2826
2820,I'm 41 regular gym visitor for one year general fitness level OK but not great Recently I started to enjoy a kickbox aerobics course at my gym I realized I hardly ever trained such rapid movements (except in soccer) but I'm improving However during the workout I cannot make the roundhouse kicks parallel to the ground without losing control let alone make high kicks What should I do to improve that Focusing on the muscles in the legs focusing on the core becoming more flexible in general (I know only slight improvements possible) all of the above I think the answer is all of the above But how to start Any suggestions for a good compilation of exercises on the gym machines or choosing a supplemental course What to avoid,fitness,2944
2830,I've been using my stationary bike to do cardio 3 times a week for about 50 minutes each session for almost 2 months now When I started off I found it very uncomfortable to sit on the seat so I got a softer seat which didn't really help Now after about 30 minutes into the session I find it very painful and am sore for about 2 days after finishing a session Is it possible to avoid getting sore,fitness,2831
2834,Just what the title says What will be the tradeoff of losing weight only by running on a treadmill instead of doing separate muscle group workout,fitness,2838
2840,Various weightlifting and exercise resources either claim that ATG squats (a**-to-ground i e as low as you can) are perfectly fine or claim they will destroy your knees in two sessions I was wondering if anyone has any insight as to what is going on here Will a properly performed (weighted) squat that brings legs below parallel to the ground have any greater negative impact on the knees or other joints compared to parallel squats Lets assume for a moment we aren't talking about competitive weightlifting weights so with a squat weight smaller than 1 5x your body mass Personally I side with the it won't do anything wrong side considering that With bar weight at approximately your body mass you could exchange the bar with squatting on one leg i e this is strain your body is designed to be able to withstand If you assume that there is the possibility of excess joint strain you would be seeing epidemic levels of knee injuries among competitive weightlifters who routinely go below parallel in the clean&amp;jerk with much greater weight and while weightlifters can get various joint injuries I haven't seen anything demonstrating that injuries are more biased towards the knee,fitness,2897
2843,I hear a lot of people talking about going to the gym to tone up their muscles What they usually do to improve their tone is to do relatively high reps with relatively low weights - say 30-50 reps with 30-50% max These exercises are done without changing anything else about their diet or exercise routine Does this sort of workout successfully tone specific muscles or a person's entire body Clarification I'm using the word tone to mean improving the shapeliness of existing muscle rather than the scientific definition muscle tension at rest,fitness,2845
2848,When doing bench presses both the left and right areas of my shoulders make this really loud clicking sound and it feels as if the bones are clicking against each other This has been happening for a few months now I thought it would go away however it remains exactly the same Any thoughts would be appreciated thanks,fitness,2861
2849,Would it be better to spread my workout into two different shifts or better to do it all at once My focus is to lose fat gain muscle I am 5'11 weight 185 lbs and I'm 26 years old I currently use Arnold's weight lifting program which I found on the web Then I do post workout cardio 45 minutes of elliptical and 15 minutes of treadmill at 3 5 - 4 0 speed I'm thinking of doing half the weight lifting in the morning with the full cardio program mentioned above Then doing the rest of the weight lifting at night with another full cardio program,fitness,2850
2853,What are some good exercise programs to lose as much body fat possible in a short period of time but still keeping it healthy A treadmill and elliptical is available to me 24/7 I am 5'11 and weight 185lbs and I have lots of body fat,fitness,2856
2855,I'm looking for some way to exercise my upper trapezius muscles using only my body weight Normally this would be accomplished with shrugs or upright rowing but without weight shrugs and rowing are practically useless I think every other muscle gets hit during my workout cycle but I'm missing my upper traps EDIT I have Erb's Palsy (right arm) due to a birth injury and hence cannot do handstands of any kind,fitness,2937
2868,I found when exercising (through Kinect pilates video etc) that I am asked to 'engage my core' How do I do this How do I know when I am truly engaging my core rather than just sucking in my stomache,fitness,2871
2869,I have had a couple of lower back surgeries in the past but I'm okay to do any activity During the last 10 years I have gained a little more weight around the mid section but have been actively trying to lose the weight but with little success I'm currently doing hot yoga to increase my flexibility but as for weight loss I'm doing cardio with some weight lifting but not seeing the results I would like to see I've also changed my diet times I've been eating and the amount I eat to a healthier diet with smaller amounts about 5 times a day I heard this would increase my metabolism I'm about 6'3 230 pounds but would like to be around 190 any advice on exercise diet etc Currently I hit the gym 2 to 3 times a week and yoga every other week I would like to do more of both but being a dad of four time is limited I have been working out in the morning for about an hour (usually cardio) and one day of the weekend for about 2 hours (Full body upper/lower),fitness,2870

2883,I've recently started taking BCAA to help me recuperate after a gym session as it was taking me a long time to recuperate Now recuperation is almost instant I'm trying to gain muscle mass which is working fairly well But wanted to know what would be the next supplement to take I'm already taking my daily protein shake (39 grams of protein) multi-vitamin Omega-3 and now BCAA I'm only taking 2 doses of the BCAA and the instructions says I can take up to three a day Any suggestions or great articles would be great I already read a lot but all everyone offers is an opinion but no real general guideline I should also note that I also take Siberian Ginseng,fitness,2884
2886,I got a shakeweight as a gag gift for Christmas I actually tried it and it does feel like you get a work out from the instructional DVD I'm curious if the principles behind the product are sound Can you really build muscle through the quick impulses of muscle contractions that device requires Can I actually look like the guy in the video from doing just Shakeweight,fitness,2889
2894,While ellipticals offer stationary movement with low impact on the knees they also seem to offer burning off insane amounts of calories when compared to equal time/work on a treadmill Same brand equipment similar workout profiles ~200 calories 30 minutes on a treadmill ~670 calories 30 minutes on an eliptical ~200 calories 30 minutes on a bike I've heard from many different sources including personal trainers both sides that ellipticals are great for burning calories and also that they are just lies The equipment I have at home all have a calorie counter that continues to climb even if i'm stationary It's making assumptions about my effort to determine calories burned so I dont believe either one The equipment at gyms ask for weight height and even use your heart rate to determine your calories burned The spread between the treadmill and the elliptical calories burned readings both from my home equipment and the gym equipment are very similar What is the truth Does the eliptical really just burn 2-3 times more calories per session than a treadmill,fitness,2898
2895,Last night at the gym I pushed myself a little too hard apperently and I threw up all over the shower I'd rather not do that again so What causes this What can I do to increase how much work I can do without throwing up,fitness,2900

2903,What is the suggested amount of time to rest muscle groups between workouts to prevent injury I want to tone (improve shapeliness of existing muscle) my body and workout on average 6 times/wk lifting weights doing high intensity aerobic classes and doing the elliptical My typical regimen at the gym involves 45 min of cardio and 6 exercises (15 reps) - 3 exercises of large muscle group (ie chest) and 3 exercises of small muscle group (ie triceps),fitness,2904
