4003,chemistry,As you move from left to right across a period the number of protons in the nucleus increases The electrons are thus attracted to the nucleus more strongly and the atomic radius is smaller (this attraction is much stronger than the relatively weak repulsion between electrons) As you move down a column there are more protons but there are also more complete energy levels below the valence electrons These lower energy levels shield the valence electrons from the attractive effects of the atom's nucleus so the atomic radius gets larger
4056,chemistry,Crystals have inspired a great many chemists because they are fascinating for a good reason Not only are they aesthetically pleasing but they serve as an excellent subject to tour a variety of theoretical subjects important for understanding high-level chemistry Crystalline materials are made up of periodic structures We're only going to primarily focus on binary compounds where there is not a high degree of covalency There are several ways to think about this problem but let's start with the melting of a crystal We say that at some definite temperature a highly ordered crystal will melt into a liquid Those of us familiar with the language of equilibrium thermodynamics might recognize that the change in free energy for this phase change can be written at constant temperature as $$ G_{liquid} - G_{crystal} = H_{liquid} - H_{crystal} - T ( S_{liquid} - S_{crystal} ) $$ $$ \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S $$ If we suppose that this process is spontaneous then we would say that the change in Gibbs' free energy is negative i e $\Delta G &lt; 0$ This is true if and only if $$\Delta H &lt; T \Delta S$$ Traditionally we interpret this as saying that there is a thermally-driven increase in entropy when we melt a highly ordered crystal into a liquid which more than offsets the energy cost associated with the enthalpies of the interactions holding that crystal together A chemist tends to learn early on that the reverse is not necessarily true at some definite temperature a perfect crystal rarely forms from the liquid This inability to just heat up any substance and always produce a perfect crystal by cooling illustrates how crystal formation is a case of kinetic- rather than thermodynamic- control So the process by which you form your crystal could possibly result in a different crystal structure Sometimes crystal structures change just by altering the temperature of the chamber you're measuring the crystal structure in Now neither of these cases apply to sodium chloride to the best of my knowledge The formation of an ionic crystal such as sodium chloride is a delicate balance between electrostatic attraction and Pauli repulsion Electrostatic attraction says that between two different charges $q_+$ and $q_-$ there is a Coulomb force given by $$F= \frac{k q_+ q_-}{r^2}$$ where $r$ is the distance between the two charges If one plays with the numbers then it's easy to see that at short distances the force is strongest but there is a limit to how close they may come together Eventually a repulsive force due to a quantum mechanical principle called the Pauli Exclusion Principle overpowers the attraction An equilibrium results in which the atoms sit a certain distance from one another so that if you will humor me the forces between them balance out This is why we traditionally represent crystal packing using marbles with a unique radii The radii of the hard marble represents where the Pauli repulsion overpowers the attraction You might say Sure we have these kinetic electrostatic and quantum mechanical factors to consider but how do these help with the final crystal structure Hold your horses we're getting there A famous mathematician and scientist thought about the most efficient ways to pack spheres of the same size together By most efficient I mean this in terms of what FedEx considers efficient fitting things together into the smallest possible volume This is also what electrostatics want Kepler sug
4013,chemistry,I think your question really arises from some confusion about what $\Delta G$ represents In general $\Delta X$ for a thermodynamic quantity $X$ is the change of $X$ along some process You could make it clear by actually writing $\Delta G(\text{A}\rightarrow\text{B})$ where A and B are before and after states (We'll note that in the general case $\Delta X$ depends on the path take from A to B making this notation improper If $X$ is a function of state though you're good to go ) However in the equation you quote $$\Delta G = \Delta G^0 + RT \ln Q$$ the $\Delta G$ is a free energy of reaction and should thus be denoted $\Delta_r G$ with the correct equation being $$\Delta_r G = \Delta_r G^0 + RT \ln Q$$ The free energy of reaction is defined as $\Delta_r G = G_{\text{products}} - G_{\text{reactants}}$ Thus this $\Delta_r G$ is not the variation of $G$ over the entire reaction which would be the $\Delta G$ of the system between the start of the reaction and the equilibrium PS I think this link is the online resource I found with the clearer use and explanation of notations Notations are important in thermodynamics
4012,chemistry,In the presence of these strong acids the NMe 2 group is partially protonated and the protonated form is meta-directing Under the conditions I know for that experiment you get a mixture of para- and meta-product but no ortho-product due to steric hindrance
4019,chemistry,Generally speaking the best solvent will be dependent on the impurity that you are trying to remove The solvent must dissolve both the desired compound and the impurity at a high temperature but only the desired compound at lower temperatures The solubility product of the impurity as well as the common ion effect should both be taken into consideration
4022,chemistry,Silver is not as inert as gold Tarnish is the name we give to the phenomenon when silver metal is oxidized and becomes a salt Surfaces made of silver tend to disinfect themselves pretty quickly As for disinfecting water poured into a silver cup I imagine that would take a little longer since you have to wait for silver to diffuse away from the surface and into the solution But even very trace levels of silver can have strong antimicrobial effects
4090,chemistry,Setting the scene for your question In Environmental Chemistry there are several pathways a chemical might travel through including being subjected to the biochemistry of an animal photodegradation chemical degradation (perhaps it slowly reacts with water etc ) uptake as a metabolite in plants degradation by soil microorganisms and this is ignoring aquatic and air pathways Say within a mouse or a fly a possible pathway for degradation for some insecticide is cleavage of the P-O bond How they have determined this in the past is noteworthy; a synthetic chemist would isotope label an atom in the molecule say $^{33}$ P -labeled or $^{14}$ C -labeled and he purified it before finally determining its specific activity Then a biochemist would dose a mouse with a solution of the compound dissolved in an appropriate solvent such as olive oil Urine and feces were collected after administration An aliquot of the collected urine for example would have its radioactivity measured using scintillation counting The organo-soluble species would be extracted from the rest of the urine and the distribution of radioactivity could then be determined between the aqueous and organic layers Then one could investigate what were present by TLC if you're old school -- they would actually run via cochromatography all the possible metabolite products they could independently think of and synthesize to identify a TLC spot (That is a lot of work ) These days we can cheat with HPLC-MS So you might ask are results from this generalizable I have to tell you that they generalize in a very rough way Enzymes are responsible for all the nifty biochemistry and they tend to be rather selective towards a given substrate and in many cases chirality even matters What they are picky about is a tough problem that is tailored to each individual enzyme One can make all kinds of generalizations about the chemical nature of the bonds and some possible predictions from it but those won't necessarily hold up in an animal model with a different molecule So nitty-gritty mechanisms might not be what we want to look at Instead we'll step back and take a broader view of this landscape We need to look at bigger items in terms of physical properties namely 1) Persistence what is its half-life in soil etc This is a matter of degradation whereas the next is all about movement of an intact molecule A simple chemical way to test this is how they resist hydrolysis 2) Mobility over time does the compound tend to sit or spread itself around For example factors that influence this are sorption how much does our chemical bind to our soil water solubility how easy it is to move in water for our chemical vaporizability how likely is the material to evaporate away from its source A famous organophosphate is malathion The partition coefficient according to the wiki page is 2 36 This implies its solubility is greater in organics than water but some of i
4065,chemistry,While nomenclature is of particular interest to organic chemists to specify an exact compound the classification of X into broad category Y or Z isn't a precise science and not really of practical use The article cites a textbook by Seager to this effect stating The distinction between organic and inorganic carbon compounds while useful in organizing the vast subject of chemistry is somewhat arbitrary Even if you find a source that says charcoal is (in)organic you may just as well find one stating the opposite Just like the coal from which it may have been produced it was once biomass and decidedly organic but so was graphite and diamond or CO 2 and CO 3 2&minus; I think it's overly pedantic and unproductive to try to come up with definitive judgements for these decidedly edge case scenarios After all it's just a chemical on the shelf what one does with it is far more relevant I don't use it on a daily basis but it seems more like a tool than a reagent The fact it contains carbon seems beside the point; it's value isn't in the chemical composition but rather its extraordinary adsorptive properties
4057,chemistry,ChemEQL is pretty nice in some instances and free but it looks like it has been mostly abandoned I'm aware of Titrator but it only runs on Windows and I've never had a chance to run it It's also free I've heard good things about Visual MINTEQ but it is Windows only and I've never had a chance to run it Supposedly well maintained There is also PHREEQC which sort of works on stuff other than Windows I hear it is harder to use but probably worth it
4093,chemistry,The obvious order is via the stability of the carbocation of the group I think you meant the migrating groups stability This is not what textbooks say Reactions are ruled by the delta G of the activated complex This may be close to educts or to products or some halfway state or a real intermediate minimum is on the reaction path So in some cases the model of a separate carbenium ion (in a ionic pair maybe) is useful sometimes You need to think of a three-center bond state
4233,chemistry,Here's two links ( 1 2 ) that show the simple scheme on forming monolayers The essential figure is also shown here For the second part of your question I can only point out this article that describes which properties change if you make the molecules more bulky or add chloride etc I would guess that APTES has well known properties and they are neutral regarding common applications
4067,chemistry,By rapid switching they technically mean Ligand-to-Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT) A more modern framework is Ligand Field Theory I would have to teach a class to fully explain it in those terms but I'll try to explain it in terms of this hybridization you brought up A chemical bond implies a higher probability of finding electrons between two bound nuclei Atomic orbitals describe the electron density for individual nuclei A bond between two nuclei necessitates some physical overlap of the relevant atomic orbitals It is in this way that we say that the linear combination of atomic orbitals say two consisting of a $2s$ and $2p$ orbital results in a molecular orbital that describes the molecule We would write the wave function for the complex as $$\Psi = C_1 \psi(2s) \pm C_2 \psi(2p)$$ The amount of mixing is just a matter of adjusting the coefficients $C_n$ And so we might say that the bond in this made-up molecule is $sp$ hybridized $sp^3$ hybridized would mean the following kind of wave function $$\Psi = C_1 \psi(2s) \pm C_2 \psi(2p) \pm C_3 \psi(2p) \pm C_4 \psi(2p)$$ Similarly $sd^3$ could mean a wave function of the following nature $$\Psi = C_1 \psi( (n+1) s) \pm C_2 \psi(n d) \pm C_3 \psi(nd) \pm C_4 \psi(nd) $$ where $n=3$ in the case of Mn or Cr If one performs the proper molecular orbital calculations on the valence $3d$ $4s$ and $4p$ for manganese or chromium and the $2s$ and $2p$ for oxygen in tetrahedral symmetry then you can draw the molecular orbital energy diagram for your complex once you match your eigenvalues to the correct trace of the appropriate transformation matrix and you can hear a bunch more jargon on it or I can explain the main point of our models why we think MnO$_4$ $^-$ is purple The bonds in specifically permanganate (I have never actually done the calculations on dichromate although they should be similar in principle) are between Mn$^{+7}$ and four O$^{-2}$ in the geometry shown here The electronegativity of oxygen clearly dictates most of the electron density and as a result has them sitting on ligands (oxygen) instead of the metal An electronically excited state can be reached with light absorption in the range of 500-600 nm light due to the relative weakness of the interactions between the ligand and metal If they were stronger interactions then it would take more energy to promote electrons into a higher energy state and the color would be shifted into the UV A colorwheel tells you that light absorption in the 500-600nm range should be approximately violet which is what we see for the color of this particular complex Anyway this excited state means some electrons temporarily move from the ligand to the metal resulting in a LMCT band
4777,chemistry,Almost certainly yes Applications of modern organic synthesis methods have drastically shortened the synthetic routes for such previously daunting targets such as strychnine see Vanderwal tetracyclines Myers and pyrroloindole alkaloids Movassaghi to name but a few - and recent efforts by Baran and White on C-H activation of alkanes have already yielded more efficient syntheses of many complex polycyclic terpenes There is no reason to think that significant improvement could not occur for chlorophyll or B12 In fact the absence of chlorophyll or Vitamin B12 from modern synthetic efforts represents a bit of a blind spot; it could well be that new chemistry could be discovered in the process Although that 1 16 hydride shift by Eschenmoser will be hard to beat -)
4034,chemistry,It's a very general statement but it's not always true I'll explain why it's often true and give a counter-example at the end Your majority component B and the impurity (let's call it A) form a binary system In most cases such binary mixtures exhibit a solid–liquid phase diagram as follows (image taken from these lecture notes ) This binary phase diagram has pure A on the left pure B on the right A and B form somewhere a eutectic It is the point here at concentration e and temperature y Because the existence of a eutectic point is guaranteed for any A/B binary system and because the eutectic corresponds to a lower temperature your liquidus curve decreases with increasing impurity concentration and the impurity thus lowers the melting point However not all binary mixtures form a eutectic In the words of Wikipedia Not all binary alloys have a eutectic point; for example in the silver-gold system the melt temperature (liquidus) and freeze temperature (solidus) both increase monotonically as the mix changes from pure silver to pure gold The corresponding phase diagram is as follows
4038,chemistry,EDIT It is clear now that NickT was looking for an experimental solution My post deals with a computational solution We can delete my response if need be until a more relevant question arises How would I quantify how significant the interaction is Determining the interaction energy between two defined monomers such as your aromatic Triazole and amide is a rather straightforward process This process is referred to as the supramolecular approach I'll point you to a paper that analyzes the benzene dimer This method is strictly a computational one so a bit of knowledge in computational chemistry is necessary The Supramolecular Approach The What The supramolecular approach boils down to this $E_{int} = E_{dimer} - (E_{mon1} + E_{mon2})$ Here we have some interaction energy ($E_{int}$) determined from the difference of a dimer energy ($E_{dimer}$) and the sum of the two monomers ($E_{monomer}$) If both monomers were equivalent (say you were interested in the interaction energy of the benzene dimer where each monomer was a benzene ring) you could simplify the summation to two times the energy of one monomer ($2E_{mon}$) In your particular case you have two different monomers The whole idea is if I have two interacting molecules I can determine the energy of each molecule individually (as if they were separated at infinite distance) as well as their complex So as you bring these molecules closer and closer together the energy starts to go down (the interaction energy) The How NOTE Your geometry is from a crystal structure Do NOT modify this geometry You will want to keep everything exactly as is This means you don't want to optimize your system You do not want to eyeball monomer placement Take everything from your known structure and be careful not to change it otherwise it can ruin this process We are modifying the structure by truncating and capping but intermolecular parameters must stay the same for whatever it is you are trying to model You will want to optimize your cap meaning run an optimization on your capped-monomer but freeze everything but the thing you are using to cap Define your monomers You will need to determine what part of your 'dimer' system is important for describing this weak interaction I recommend keeping the aromatic ring and truncating the ring with something similar to what is being truncated You could cap your monomer with a hydrogen or a methyl group for example If the piece you've cut out is highly polarizable cap with something with a similar property If your truncated piece is neutral in charge cap with something that is neutral You get the idea Define your dimer Your dimer is simply a combination of your two defined monomers Determine the method you want to implement Post-Hartree-Fock methods are essential for this Note that if you use the widely-implemented MP2 method your answer may be way off (can over-estimate pi-pi interactions by as much as 200% ) The CCSD(T) method is recommended Define your basis set For aromatic systems your best bet would be to use Dunning-Hunzaga's correlation consistent family of basis sets I recommend using aug-cc-pVTZ for good results Whatever you decide be sure your basis set includes polarization and diffuse functions The suggested basis set does this (augmented means diffuse on all atoms whereas pVTZ means 'polarized-valence triple zeta') Determine the energies of your monomers and dimer You will want to run a single-point energy ca
4051,chemistry,An $\alpha \beta$-unsaturated ketone is electrodeficient at the $\beta$ position This can be seen if you draw the resonance structures of such a molecule The $\beta$ carbon is thus a good site for nucleophilic attack But as you know carbonyls are also prone to nucleophilic attack To discriminate between the two you need to look at how the reaction is controlled either thermodynamically or kinetically In a kinetically controlled reaction the product that is formed fastest predominates In a thermodynamically controlled reaction the predominant product is the energetically favored one A Michael addition is a 1-4 addition where a nucleophile attacks the $\beta$ carbon and produces the thermodynamically favored product On the other hand a 1-2 reaction (on the carbonyl) gives the kinetic product and is obtained at low temperatures Why is the 1-4 product thermodynamically more stable Because the resulting product benefits from keto-enol tautomerism which results in lowering the energy of the system Usually the more resonance forms a compound has the more its electrons are delocalized the more stable it is Draw the resonance forms of the 1-4 and 1-2 products and see You asked for specific affinities of different organometallics in 1-4/1-2 additions My knowledge is that organocuprates ($\mathrm{R-CuLi}$) will perform Michael additions and that organolithians seem to prefer 1-2 addition Also according to this source Grignard reagents do not seem to have a preference My take on this is that the cuprate is less reactive and therefore can form the thermodynamic product whereas the lithium reagent is so destabilized that it reacts right away
4362,chemistry,Ok I will try my hand on the mechanism In my opinion the reaction should work with a catalytic amount of $\ce{H+}$ since the key step for the reaction is the hydrolysis of the orthoester This is an entropically very favourable reaction since from one reactant molecule you get two product molecules The resulting molecule is extremely reactive So it can easily react with the enolized malonate The enolization might be facilitated by the $\ce{ZnCl2}$ and/or the cat $\ce{H+}$ (I'm not entirely sure whether the $\ce{ZnCl2}$ really plays the role I've given it below in this reaction So if anyone knows good arguments against it please let me know ) The protonated product can then take part in an $\mathrm{E}1$ elimination reaction to yield ethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate The carbocation which results when $\ce{EtOH}$ leaves the molecule is stabilized by the neighboring ethoxy group The hydrogen on the central carbon atom is very acidic since it is placed between three carboxylate groups so it can even be removed by rather non-basic molecules e g by an $\ce{EtOH}$ a malonate or an othoester molecule So much for the acid catalysed mechanism Now for the question why one doesn't simply use a base to facilitate the addition of the activated methylene compound Well this is due to the fact that orthoesters are quite stable against basic hydrolysis So under basic conditions you don't get the carbonyl component of the addition reaction
4055,chemistry,The difficulty with creating an ionic bond glass is that creating true glasses depends on a combination of directional bonding between atoms (or molecules) and a rate of cooling that doesn't give those bonds time to move into optimal positions The result is a bit like piling together sticky spheres that become locked before they can find an optimal stacking arrangement Pure ionic bonds in contrast are more like slippery spheres that are attracted towards each others' centers but don't have any particular preferences about which parts of their surfaces make contact Given that the most likely result by far from very rapid cooling of a molten ionic solid will be to produce micro or nanocrystalline ionic solids that may superficially resemble glasses but which under X-ray or neutron diffraction crystallography would prove actually to have crystal structure at a very fine scale With that said you nonetheless can come up with a recipe for trying to make a truly glassy ionic solid especially since there's no such thing as a pure ionic bond You would want to cool a very thin layer of molten salt at at an incredibly high rate at least millions of degrees per second if I recall glassy metal cooling rates rightly For ionic you would also want the result to be pretty close to absolute zero since whatever degree of directional stickiness you can get out of ionic solids is likely to be less even than metallic bonds Finally if you really want to try to make such a thing as a serious project you of course must check the literature in detail My rule of thumb is that if you dig deep enough there are almost no decently plausible ideas that you can think of in the physical sciences that someone has not at least written a paper on in some journal and maybe even done some experiments Still what you are asking is an intriguing idea for a real experiment and it wasn't that many years ago that both metallic glasses and Penrose-tiled quasicrystals were new ideas
4435,chemistry,Nitrile gloves are made of nitrile rubber or poly(butadiene/acrylonitrile) This polymer is highly soluble in chloroform with some papers I found indicating that one can dissolve up to 18% in mass of nitrile butadiene rubber in chloroform Moreover it permeates easily through NBR meaning we can expect the dissolution to be fast in addition to thermodynamically favourable Finally I would not expect the mechanism here to be any different from that of any polymer dissolution by a good solvent The solvent will permeate through the polymer intercalate between polymer chains and solvate them (inducing swelling) Once solvated the network of polymer chains looses its mechanical properties and they can fully separate (I wish I could find a good existing illustration for that part but I can't right now… If anyone can feel free to edit )
4104,chemistry,The currently accepted hydrogenation mechanism for metal like palladium is the Horiuti-Polanyi mechanism ( image ) This mechanism works with good yield for alkenes and alkynes For an aromatic compound the activation energy is much higher because the aromaticity of the target molecule is being broken by the first hydrogenation Indeed 1 3-cyclohexadiene is very unstable and will revert to benzene and hydrogen instead of continuing to cyclohexane Addition of a Lewis Acid makes palladium an acceptable catalyst for the hydrogenation of benzene however An intermediate compound with the benzene and the LA is first formed and hydrogen is added to this intermediate This paper discusses the mechanism of hydrogenation in the presence of a Lewis Acid Rhodium catalysts work slightly differently They generally have ligands attached that help stabilize the intermediates You can see a simplified mechanism here and there are papers discussing specific catalysts here and here Basically in the case of benzene the relatively unstable 1 2-cyclohexadiene is held in place on the catalyst until it has been completely hydrogenated
4075,chemistry,It has to be so common a question that the answer is actually given in various places on Dupont's own website (Dupont are the makers of Teflon) “If nothing sticks to Teflon® then how does Teflon® stick to a pan Nonstick coatings are applied in layers just like paint The first layer is the primer—and it's the special chemistry in the primer that makes it adhere to the metal surface of a pan And from this other webpage of theirs The primer (or primers if you include the “mid coat” in the picture above) adheres to the roughened surface often obtained by sandblasting very strongly it's chemisorption and the primer chemical nature is chosen as to obtain strong bonding to both the metal surface Then the PTFE chain extremities create bonds with the primer And thus it stays put
4066,chemistry,Well shaking a sep-funnel is a great way of creating a horrible intractable emulsion with no clear phase boundary so don't do that (also the stopper might pop off as soon as you set it down) As for breaking an emulsion if you have the time just leave the sep-funnel somewhere and wait a few days I seem to recall the first and last time I shook a sep-funnel the lab tech added some salt to the water/diethyl ether emulsion however I'm not clear on this Finally consider sacrificing part of your product by drawing the funnel off to the very base of where the emulsion begins draining the emulsion layer entirely and then taking the remainder If you have blobs of one phase in the other you may be able to remove them with a pipette
4078,chemistry,Which nuclei you should consider as neighboring atoms for the multiplet splitting depends on the size of the coupling constant The coupling constant are usually named after the number of bonds between the coupling nuclei so a coupling between two hydrogens that are three bonds apart from each other would be a $\mathrm{^3J_{HH}}$-coupling In an alkyl chain like CH 3 CH 2 the coupling between the CH2 and the CH3 hydrogens would be a $\mathrm{^3J}$-coupling that is about 7 Hz large Couplings over more than three bonds are usually not observed because they are smaller than the linewidth of the signals in your NMR spectrum The exception to that you're likely to encounter are couplings along C=C double bonds where you can even see $\mathrm{^4J}$-couplings or more So the simplified rule would be that couplings along three bonds are visible couplings along more than three bonds are only visible when there is at least one C=C double bond along the way The concepts of chemical and magnetic equivalence are essential to understanding how different multiplicities arise Chemical equivalence means there exists a symmetry operation that exchanges those nuclei Magnetically equivalent nuclei additionally need to have identical couplings to all other spins in the molecule Magnetically equivalent nuclei don't couple to each other In propane the hydrogens of both CH 3 groups are three bonds away from the hydrogens of the CH 2 group so the coupling between those is visible in the NMR spectrum The hydrogens of each CH 3 group are magnetically equivalent due to the fast rotation along the C–C bond and the two CH 3 groups should also be magnetically equivalant So you have 6 magnetically equivalent hydrogens that couple to your CH 2 hydrogens The result of that is a splitting into a septet (7) The OH-group is an interesting exception as you would expect it to lead to a visible coupling on hydrogens connected to the same carbon but you don't observe that under most conditions The reason is that the OH is acidic enough that the hydrogen exchanges quickly with the solvent so the hydrogen dissasociates and associates quickly This happens too fast for NMR so the other nuclei only see the average OH-hydrogen This eliminates the coupling to the OH and it is also the reason why the OH-signal is often very broad or even completely gone in NMR spectra
21319,chemistry,Permeation of protons potassium ions and small polar molecules through phospholipid bilayers as a function of membrane thickness Reported values for proton permeability coefficients vary over a wide range from $10^{-2} \ \mathrm{cm/s}$ to $10^{-7} \ \mathrm{cm/s}$ (Nichols and Deamer 1980; Nichols et al 1980; Biegel and Gould 1981; Elamrani and Blume 1983; Grzesiek and Dencher 1986; Perkins and Cafiso 1986; Norris and Powell 1990) This variation relates to the use of different techniques lipids and bilayer systems (liposomes and planar bilayers) or different pH ranges (Perkins and Cafiso 1986) The proton data of this study agree with the higher reported values As revealed by Fig 4 proton permeability coefficients strongly depend on membrane thickness starting at a maximum value of $1 3 \cdot 10^{-2} \ \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the shortest lipid and steadily decreasing to a value of $4 9 \cdot 10^{-5} \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the longest lipid It follows that proton permeability decreases by a factor of approximately 250 as the thickness of the hydrophobic region is increased from $20 \ \mathring{\mathrm{A}}$ to $37 \ \mathring{\mathrm{A}}$
4318,chemistry,I'm not sure why you're wanting to exert so much effort to find the charge of compounds If you really want to know the charge determine it more directly Electrophoresis can allow you to do so A charged species is put in a capillary tube that is in between a cathode an an anode When a charged species is subjected to an electric field it will experience a force proportional to its charge and the field strength Drag forces present in the solvent are also a consideration in this setup and they depend on the size of your ion as well as viscosity of your solvent One also has to worry about Joule heating as an increase in temperature will cause poor reproducibility Picking a suitable detector is fun but hopefully you can get by with the common UV-vis detector So if you can find a suitable setup know the radius of your ion and know the time between injection of your sample and its arrival at a detector you can at least determine its effective charge
4077,chemistry,The molecular origin of the Hofmeister series is not well understood and still a very active area of research For example see the upcoming Faraday discussion conference The syllabus for the conference says Although it is now clear that the Hofmeister series is intimately connected with ion hydration in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments and with ion pairing the molecular origin of these effects has been poorly understood Biochemists and physical chemists have been typically using the term Hofmeister series to put a label on ion specific behaviour in various environments rather than to reach a molecular level understanding and consequently an ability to predict a particular effect of a specific salt ion (So this is not an answer but rather too long for a comment…)
4086,chemistry,Some information on Side chain oxidation in alkylbenzenes is available here http //www chemguide co uk/organicprops/arenes/other html An alkylbenzene is simply a benzene ring with an alkyl group attached to it Methylbenzene is the simplest alkylbenzene Alkyl groups are usually fairly resistant to oxidation However when they are attached to a benzene ring they are easily oxidised by an alkaline solution of potassium manganate(VII) (potassium permanganate) Methylbenzene is heated under reflux with a solution of potassium manganate(VII) made alkaline with sodium carbonate The purple colour of the potassium manganate(VII) is eventually replaced by a dark brown precipitate of manganese(IV) oxide The mixture is finally acidified with dilute sulphuric acid Overall the methylbenzene is oxidised to benzoic acid Interestingly any alkyl group is oxidised back to a -COOH group on the ring under these conditions So for example propylbenzene is also oxidised to benzoic acid A Chemistry student at UBC did his doctorate on the mechanism https //circle ubc ca/handle/2429/32304 and for the pdf see https //circle ubc ca/bitstream/handle/2429/32304/UBC_1973_A1%20S65 pdf sequence=1 It was found that the most vigorous oxidant was permanganyl ion (MnO??) with some contributing oxidation by both permanganic acid (HMnO?) and permanganate ion (MnO??) in the case of easily oxidized compounds such as alcohols aldehydes or enols The mechanism of the acidic permanganate oxidation of alkanes (ethane to n-tridecane) was found to proceed via rate-determining homolytic carbon-hydrogen bond scission as depicted below [See Thesis for Diagrams] The -mechanism of arene oxidation was shown to proceed via rate-determining electrophilic attack by permanganyl ion on the aromatic ring to yield ring degradation products Phenols are believed to be intermediates in this process as depicted below [See Thesis for Diagrams] The mechanisms of the oxidation of alcohols ketones aldehydes and formic acid were determined and shown to be consistent with mechanisms previously established under other conditions
4101,chemistry,Copper (II) is almost always blue so I'm not sure how much luck you'll have trying to change the color CuCl$_2$ is one of the few solutions I can think of off the top of my head that isn't blue - it's more greenish-blue CuCl$_2$ can be made via electrolysis of NaCl and copper plates You could also make CuCl$_2$ if you add hydrochloric acid and some NaCl
4173,chemistry,This question raises more important issues than just the technical why methyl ester so I'll address those too The easiest explanation for their focus on the methyl ester is that the ethyl ester just isn't nearly as sweet This report says it is approximately 10x less sweet (see Table VI on page 2689 and the entry 'Asp-Phe-OEt' with ++ being defined on pg 2684) It's an easy economic choice between the two assuming the only difference is sweetness/g but you're also worried about the perceived safety concerns of the methyl derivative A toxicology class I once took can mostly be summed up by a cliche phrase the dose makes the poison Even too much of a good thing is by definition a bad thing for example too much oxygen water or even the sun can lead to death We also say that too little of any compound won't cause measurable harm It's correct to say that aspartame will be metabolized into amino acids and methanol Methanol itself is toxic in high doses in the same manner ethanol is by acting as a CNS depressant This acute poisoning can cause respiratory failure or other medical emergencies such as kidney failure Ethanol poisoning occurs in microorganisms too it has been proposed that some yeast produce ethanol as a means of eliminating competition This would have been potentially deadly for a prehistoric mammal too if it were not for enzymes which metabolize ethanol called alcohol dehydrogenase ADH lead to biochemical pathways that allow the safe removal of ethanol but methanol is a different case ADH instead make formaldehyde which is then converted to formic acid by ALDH Formic acid in large quantities is used in the animal kingdom as a weapon most notably in bee venom and from the bites of a fire ant In low quantities it is fairly benign Formaldehyde is just a nasty chemical Both are produced in the body as a natural response to methanol and it's easy to see how too much of either couldn't possibly be desirable The body also has ways to eliminate these toxic metabolites assuming you don't overwhelm these systems Hence why a sufficiently small amount of methanol won't make you blind Researchers have measured the amount of these undesirable metabolites in the blood after having people like me ingest nearly 1 8 g of aspartame in one sitting Then they looked at urine and blood concentrations and they couldn't detect any formic acid in the blood but they could clearly see it in their urine for up to 8 hours after a dose This evidence suggests that acute methanol poisoning isn't going to happen after a ~ 200 lbs person ingests 1 8 g of aspartame Let's stop for a second and put this in terms of something we can imagine I don't have any reliable numbers but let's just say that for a 12 oz diet pop there are 200 mg of aspartame That means for every liter of pop there are approximately 564 mg of aspartame That means 3 liters of pop would get me to 1 8 g of aspartame That means I would need to drink more than 3 L in one sitting to overwhelm the excretion systems This suggests an acute poisoning isn't very plausible There is however long-term toxicity to consider as well This is a much more difficult que
4095,chemistry,I am not an expert in the field but a quick literature check turns up a good amount of papers on the topic In particular I found this paper [1] which nicely answers the question for guanine So in the gas phase the most stable enol tautomer has a 0 9 kcal/mol free energy difference with the most stable keto tautomer That free energy difference is very exacerbated in aqueous solution with now a ?G° = 8 7 kcal/mol We also notice that the most stable keto tautomer is not the same in the gas phase and in solution and that both keto and enol have many tautomers close in free energy showing the limits of the simple keto vs enol line of thought Regarding uracil the first reference that comes up in a bibliographic search is this paper [2] I only quote the abstract The effects of the solvent on the tautomeric equilibria of cytosine and uracil are studied using Onsager's reaction field model in the framework of density functional theory […] Our results are in good agreement with available experimental results and confirm that the polarization of the solute by the continuum has important effects on the absolute and relative solvation energies pKa Values of Guanine in Water Density Functional Theory Calculations Combined with Poisson-Boltzmann Continuum-Solvation Model Y H Jang et al J Phys Chem B 2003 DOI 10 1021/jp020774x Solvent effects in density functional calculations of uracil and cytosine tautomerism L Paglieri et al Quantum Chem 2004 DOI 10 1002/qua 560560517
4097,chemistry,Other than the excellent answer by F'x there is also actual spectroscopy specifically UV/Vis spectroscopy This'll only work if the metal has transitions in the right range though -- transition metals lanthanides and actinides are usually fine s or p -block metals and metalloids probably not Then you're looking for the absorption/transmission spectrum of the ion and the metal separately and how much of each there is in a combined spectrum It's not strictly quantitative but you can get a good idea of the ratios
4098,chemistry,Questions about why we represent things in one way or another are hard to answer in general because they appeal to one’s sense of taste… de gustibus non est disputandum Here I want to state the position and the reasoning of IUPAC on this matter The relevant publication on this are the IUPAC 2008 Recommandations titled Graphical representation standards for chemical structure diagrams (IUPAC Recommendations 2008) [1] Section GR-6 of the report deals with “Aromatic rings and other types of electron delocalization” I quote part of it (emphasis is mine) GR-6 5 Curves should only be used when delocalization is being represented Curves represent delocalization yet lots of structures have some delocalized elements Although all such elements could be depicted with curves there is little gained by doing so On the contrary the arbitrary use of curves can draw the viewer’s attention to insignificant portions of a structural diagram and away from areas that are chemically more important such as an active site or a reactive group Accordingly curves should only be used when the delocalization is specifically being highlighted as an important feature of the structure When curves are not used any alternating configuration of double bonds is acceptable within the further constraints discussed in GR-3 5 The text then goes further to note It is generally not acceptable to use curves in two adjacent fused rings since such diagrams are at best ambiguous in terms of the character of the shared fusion bond between the two rings Graphical representation standards for chemical structure diagrams (IUPAC Recommendations 2008) Pure Appl Chem 2008 DOI 10 1351/pac200880020277 PS hmm the leader for the IUPAC report works at CambridgeSoft…
4106,chemistry,Although I can't think of any drug examples other than thalidomide here's information on thalidomide's mechanism The chiral carbon of thalidomide can tautomerize in basic conditions into an enol which is achiral A reversal back to the ketone results in a mix of (R) and (S) enantiomers In the body this tautomerization is generally catalyzed by basic amino acids Specifically albumin is the main catalyst in humans While this is beyond the scope of your question the reason that only (S) -thalidomide causes birth defects is that it can insert itself into DNA and suppresses certain genes necessary for embryonic development Reddy - Chirality in Drug Design and Development http //www ncbi nlm nih gov/pubmed/9860497 http //www ncbi nlm nih gov/pubmed/9499573
4338,chemistry,Some factors were hinted but let me put them in an order of importance and mention some more metals generally have a high melting point because metallic interatomar bonding by delocalized electrons (Li having only few electrons for this electron sea ) between core atoms is pretty effective in those pure element solids compared to alternative bonding types (ionic 6-20 eV/atom bond energy covalent 1-7 metallic 1-5 van-der-waals much lower) Also ionic lattices like NaCl have a higher lattice and bonding energy they have weak interatomar long-range bonding unlike most metals They break apart or are easily solvable metals are malleable but don't break the electron sea is the reason for their welding ability the crystal structure and mass plays a inferior role among your filtered elements (just look up the crystal structure of those elements) as metallic bonding is not directional unlike covalent bonding (orbital symmetry) Metals often have half filled s and p bands (stronger delocalized than d and f) at the fermi-edge (meaning high conductivity) and therefore many delocalised electrons which can move into unoccupied energy states yielding the biggest electron sea with half or less fill bands noble metals like Au Ag have a full d orbital therefore low reactivity/electronnegativity and are often used as contact materials (high conductivity because of very fluid electron sea consisting only of s-orbital electrons Unlike Tungsten with half or less occupied d-orbitals they show no interatomic d-d bonding by delocalized d-electrons and more importantly a half filled d-orbital contributes 5 electrons to the energy band while a s only 1 p only 3 the electron sea is bigger among the d-group The packaging of core atoms in the lattice (interatomic distance) among the high Z atoms (compared to e g Li) is more dense (more protons stronger attraction of shell electrons smaller interatomic radius) means stronger interatomar bonding transmitted by the electron sea You can see here that in each series (Li Na Ka) the melting points rise to a maximum and then decrease with increasing atomic number (lacking unoccupied energy states for delocalized d-electrons) bigger electron sea being here a stronger factor than a bit more dense packaging Boron as a semi-metal shows metallic and covalent bonding Carbon strong directional covalent bonding and is able to build network of bonds unlike other non-metal elements showing covalent intramolecular bonding e g in diatomic molecules but not strong intermolecular bonding in macromolecules because of lacking unpaired electrons So there are some bigger trends for melting points explaining the high melting points of d-metals but also some minor exceptions to the rule like Mn
4186,chemistry,In the definition of an s shell you will find that its l (letter ell ) number is zero In classical terms that corresponds to an orbit with zero orbital or angular momentum — which for a large object is a clear impossibility For an electron it gives the peculiar result that any electron in any s shell is classically speaking moving back and forth through the nucleus rather than around it So in one curious sense what you just asked is exactly what happens the classical analogy is that the electrons do go through the nucleus which is why they have such a lovely spherical symmetry The second part of the answer however is that electrons can't go through the nucleus unless they are hugely more energetic than the ones found in a typical small-nucleus atom Clearly there's a bit of a paradox going on there The resolution of the paradox is that very-low-mass charged particles must be treated by quantum rules So for example rather than the electron behaving like a well-defined particle it behaves like a standing wave That standing wave can in turn be thought of as two simultaneous versions of the electron one going (for example) clockwise and the other counterclockwise around (The real situation has an infinite number of such components; I'm just picking out a single pair of them that demonstrate the principle ) Each of these components can furthermore be thought of as being refracted by the powerful spherical charge field of the nucleus curving around it without every striking it This refraction is not the same as an attraction In fact it is this refraction effect that prevents the density of the electron cloud from reaching infinity at the nucleus — that is from striking the nucleus If you think of how a tank of water can cause a beam of light to bounce off the surface instead of entering the tank — and that's a terrible analogy I know I know — you can at least get some idea of how an increasing optical density towards a central point might keep light away rather than bringing it closer So for an electron that behaves like two waves going both clockwise and counterclockwise the combined waves curve around the nucleus rather than striking it This is a very quantum sort of event since for a classical object such splitting of the object is simply not possible and the object simply dives straight into the source of attraction But if objects are light enough that kind of particle-like behavior simply ceases to be available to the object Instead you get waves that neatly and with perfect spherical symmetry curve around the nucleus never obtaining enough energy (which makes it more particle-like) to connect directly with that nucleus Finally notice that electrons in s (and other) shells necessarily combine multiple paths all at the same time For each image of the electron that is traveling clockwise there must also be an exactly balancing image of the same electron traveling counterclockwise so that the two images always balance out to zero orbital momentum What an amazing thing that is And an important thing too since it's what makes chemistry possible So good question even if it really is more of a physics question per se than a chemistry question But it's such an important chemistry question It's like asking how the engine that powers the car works You can accept it as a given that all cars and vehicles have engines and that they all work in a certain way However sometimes it's nice to dive in a little deeper and try to understand why these peculiar things do the things that make chemistry possible — that is how the engine really works
4150,chemistry,In addition to the general rules of how electronic configurations of atoms and ions are calculated the elements from the $d$ block (aka the transition metals ) obey one special rule In general electrons are removed from the valence-shell s orbitals before they are removed from valence d orbitals when transition metals are ionized (I took this formulation from this online lecture notes but you will find equivalent statements in your textbooks ) So what that does mean is that if you remove electrons from vanadium (0) you will remove the 4 s electrons before you remove the 3 d electrons So you have the following electronic configurations V is [Ar] 4 s 2 3 d 3 V 2+ is [Ar] 4 s 0 3 d 3 V 3+ is [Ar] 4 s 0 3 d 2 V 4+ is [Ar] 4 s 0 3 d 1 V 5+ is [Ar] 4 s 0 3 d 0 And thus V 3+ is paramagnetic because it has two unpaired 3 d electrons In fact all the ions above are paramagnetic except V 5+
4160,chemistry,As I understand this there are basically two effects at work here When you populate an s orbital you add a significant amount of electron density close to the nucleus This screens the attractive charge of the nucleus from the d orbitals making them higher in energy (and more radially diffuse) The difference in energy between putting all the electrons in d orbitals and putting one in an s orbital increases as you fill the d orbitals Additionally pairing electrons in one orbital (so adding the second s electron) carries a significant energy cost in terms of Coulombic repulsion because you're adding an electron essentially in exactly the same space as there's already an electron I'm assuming that the effect isn't strong enough to avert fluorine having a $2s^2$ occupation and if you look at gadolinium the effect there isn't strong enough to stop the s from filling (large nuclear charge and orbital extent at the nucleus is a good combination energy-wise) it does manage to make it more favourable to add the electron into the 5d instead of the 4f orbitals Also if you take a look at tungsten vs gold there the effect isn't strong enough for tungsten to avoid a $6s^2$ occupation but is for gold - more d electrons making the screening effect overcome the strong nuclear charge and enhanced nuclear penetration of an s orbital
4376,chemistry,I think your question implicates another question (which is also mentioned in some comments here) namely Why are all energy eigenvalues of states with a different angular momentum quantum number $\ell$ but with the same principal quantum number $n$ (e g $3s$ $3p$ $3d$) degenerate in the hydrogen atom but non-degenerate in multi-electron atoms Although AcidFlask already gave a good answer (mostly on the non-degeneracy part) I will try to eleborate on it from my point of view and give some additional information I will split my answer in three parts The first will address the $\ell$-degeneracy in the hydrogen atom in the second I will try to explain why this degeneracy is lifted and in the third I will try to reason why $3s$ states are lower in energy than $3p$ states (which are in turn lower in energy than $3d$ states) $\ell$-degeneracy of the hydrogen atoms energy eigenvalues The non-relativistic electron in a hydrogen atom experiences a potential that is analogous to the Kepler problem known from classical mechanics This potential (aka Kepler potential) has the form $\frac{\kappa}{r}$ where $r$ is the distance between the nucleus and the electron and $\kappa$ is a proportionality constant Now it is known from physics that symmetries of a system lead to conserved quantities ( Noether Theorem ) For example from the rotational symmetry of the Kepler potential follows the conservation of the angular momentum which is characterized by $\ell$ But while the length of the angular momentum vector is fixed by $\ell$ there are still different possibilities for the orientation of its $z$-component characterized by the magnetic quantum number $m$ which are all energetically equivalent as long as the system maintains its rotational symmetry So the rotational symmetry leads to the $m$-degeneracy of the energy eigenvalues for the hydrogen atom Analogously the $\ell$-degeneracy of the hydrogen atoms energy eigenvalues can also be traced back to a symmetry the $SO(4)$ symmetry The system's $SO(4)$ symmetry is not a geometric symmetry like the one explored before but a so called dynamical symmetry which follows from the form of the Schroedinger equation for the Kepler potential (It corresponds to rotations in a four-dimensional cartesian space Note that these rotations do not operate in some physical space ) This dynamical symmetry conserves the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector $\hat{\vec{M}}$ and it can be shown that this conserved quantity leads to the $\ell$-independent energy spectrum with $E \propto \frac{1}{n^2}$ (A detailed derivation though in German can be found here ) Why is the $\ell$-degeneracy of the energy eigenvalues lifted in multi-electron atoms As the $m$-degeneracy of the hydrogen atom's energy eigenvalues can be broken by destroying the system's spherical symmetry e g by applying a magnetic field the $\ell$ degeneracy is lifted as soon as the potential appearing in the Hamilton operator deviates from the pure $\frac{\kappa}{r}$ form This is certainly the case for multielectron atoms since the outer electrons are screened from the nuclear Coulomb attraction by the inner electrons and the strength of the screening depends on their distance from the nucleus (Other factors like spin and relativistic effects also lead to a lifting of the $\ell$-degeneracy even in the hydrogen atom ) Why do states with the same $n$ but lower $\ell$ values have lower energy eigenvalues Two effects are important here The <stron
4155,chemistry,There are several ways that enantiomers can be separated but none of them are particularly simple The first way to separate them is chiral chromatography In chiral chromatography silical get is bonded to chiral molecules to form what is called a chiral stationary phase The enantiomers will then separate as they run down the column because one of the enantiomers will interact more strongly with the column and stick in place Chiral sugars (ex cellulose) are frequently used in chiral chromatography The second common method is to react the enantiomers with another chemical to form diastereomers While enantiomers are identical in terms of chemical properties diastereomers are not Diastereomers can be created by reacting a mixture of both the enantiomers with another chiral molecule For example s -brucine is commonly used because it is cheap Diastereomers have different chemical properties (for example melting points) so it is much easier to separate them Then after separation the enantiomers can be recovered from the single diastereomer
4322,chemistry,It's not exactly clear from your question what distances you consider but I have taken snapshots of a methylcyclohexane with the methyl group in the equatorial and axial positions       (equatorial)    (axial) The distance of the methyl H atoms to the nearest cyclohexane H atoms are displayed and you'll see that indeed the axial position has a shorted H–H distance of ~ 2 Å while equatorial position has longer H–H distances Also as others have remarked in the comments only the groups (and H atoms) directly on the cyclohexane ring are said to be in axial or equatorial position Atoms of side chains do not follow this terminology in particular for side chains that can rotate freely as it means nothing there
8681,chemistry,If you're still interested in this fluorescence may be a good method to test the phosphate dependence on magnesium activity First record a fluorescence spectrum of a solution of magnesium and fluorescent dye then add small volumes of concentrated phosphate and note any changes in the fluorescence Of course you would have to do a control experiment to see if the phosphate is directly perturbing the fluorescence This write-up describes some magnesium-chelating dyes that you could use though if you don't want to spend a lot of money on a dye you may already have some chemicals in your lab that will work Phenol looks like promising alternative as it fluoresces is decently water soluble (83 g/L) and forms a complex with magnesium which breaks planarity which would certainly change the fluorescence spectrum It would only take a day to get accurate quantitative results if you have access to a fluorometer
4166,chemistry,This exception rule is actually orbital filling rule For two electrons to be in same orbital they need to have different spins (Pauli exclusion principal) This electron pairing requires additional energy and thus it is easier to add electrons if there are free orbitals When element has a half-filled p sublevel all 3 orbitals have one electron and pairing takes place (difference between energy levels of 2p and 3s is greater than electron pairing energy) Electron pairing effects have significant impact to physical properties of coordination complexes (like color and magnetic properties)
4165,chemistry,The two hydrogens are the same but some periodic tables show hydrogen in both places to emphasize that hydrogen isn't really a member of the first group or the seventh group Hydrogen is a diatomic gas in it's elemental state which is different from the other group one metals (and similar to the group seven elements) At the same time hydrogen usually loses its electron similar to sodium and the other group one metals
4171,chemistry,Well you have to ask how stable and compared to what Epoxides including ethylene oxide are generally considered relatively unstable molecules with a high chemical activity and involvement in numerous reactions including polymerization and thermal decomposition However ethylene oxide does exist as a molecule as does cyclopropane which also contains a three-membered ring So let's compare for example the ring strain in ethylene oxide and cyclopropane I found some computation data on their relative stability from these lecture notes which indicate that “ethylene oxide has less ring strain than cyclopropane” I would attribute this to the fact that the C–O–C angle has less strain because its “relaxed” value would be 104 5° compared to the “relaxed” C–C–C angle of 109 4°
4183,chemistry,In short I think the answer is that although the overall symmetry of the buckminsterfullerene is almost spherical the quadrupole–quadrupole interaction with other molecules with aromatic cycles are local (in addition to the ever-present van der Waals interactions) I tried to think of a way to exemplify that and drew the 2D picture below In this 2D model the “double bonds” of the circular structure represent the individual aromatic rings of your buckminsterfullerene ( which isn't superaromatic i e electrons are not delocalized over its entire structure ; think may be a key point) bearing each a local quadrupole moment (symbolized in the red/blue thingy) The other particle with a quadrupole is close to one of the ball's quadrupoles and this local interaction dominates In fact other interactions maybe be stabilizing or not depending on the orientation of the individual quadrupoles but they are weaker that the local quadrupole–quadrupole interaction
4451,chemistry,Having embarrassed myself with my first answer let me try this again Ammonia and water hydrogen bond exceptionally well In fact the $\ce{O-H N}$ value is 29 kJ/mol while the $\ce{O-H O}$ value is 21 kJ/mol ( Ref ) So if there is any water around ammonia would be happy to become solvated as they recondense Also ammonia is a weak base and reacts with water (which is not usually the case when you're doing a distillation) $$\ce{NH3 + H2O &lt;=&gt; NH4+ + OH-}$$ So if there's any water around as the ammonia is distilling and they recombine they would also react which would make it difficult to remove the last of the water (Some reaction would occur because the lowest energy point of the equilibrium is not at reactants or products ) So as noted in the comments distillations to prepare dry ammonia use a scrubber to remove the water
4181,chemistry,The boiling point of a liquid depends on the intermolecular forces present between the atoms or molecules in the liquid since you must disrupt those forces to change from a liquid to a gas The stronger the intermolecular forces the higher the boiling point Two oxygen molecules are attracted to each other through London dispersion forces (induced temporary dipoles between the molecules) while water molecules are attracted to each other by hydrogen bonding (attraction of the + dipole on H in one molecule to the – dipole on an oxygen in an adjacent molecule) that is relatively strong (Hydrogen bonding is an important intermolecular force for molecules where H is directly covalently bonded to F O or N which are quite electronegative and thus form bond with H with a relatively strong dipole ) London dispersion forces become more important for atoms and molecules with more electrons Dipole–dipole attractions are also important in some molecules
4188,chemistry,It should be noted that ammonia is a mildly polar solvent and that (for instance) you can prepare $\ce{[Cu(NH3)6]^{2+}}$ by reaction with liquid ammonia 1 The description of the geometry (two pages earlier) of $\ce{CuSO4\cdot{}5H2O}$ (namely containing a square planar $\ce{[Cu(H2O)4]^{2+}}$ unit with two additional $\ce{[SO4]^{2-}}$ above and below the plane) suggests that ammine ligands could fulfill a similar role to water Bear in mind that passing ammonia gas over a solid will probably mean that if the reaction happens it will only happen near grain surfaces To answer your second suggestion Housecroft and Sharpe 1 identifies a reaction producing $\ce{[Ag(NH3)_4]^{+}}$ from $\ce{Ag2O}$ in liquid $\ce{NH3}$ Hope this is informative [1] Housecroft C E and Sharpe A G ; Inorganic Chemistry 2e; Pearson Prentice Hall; 2005 pp 635-637 693
4192,chemistry,Cartesian Space In Cartesian space three variables (XYZ) are used to describe the position of a point in space typically an atomic nucleus or a basis function To describe the locations of two atomic nuclei a total of 6 variables must be written down and kept track of The general ruling is that for Cartesian space 3N variables must be accounted for (where N is the number of points in space you wish to index) Internal Coordinates Z-matrices use a different approach When dealing with Z-matrices we keep track of the relative positions of points in space Cartesian space is 'absolute' so to speak A point located at (0 0 1) is an absolute location for a coordinate space that extends to infinity However consider a two atom system The translation of the molecule through space (assuming a vacuum) will have no affect on the properties of the molecule An H2 molecule centered around the origin (0 0 0) is no different from the same H2 molecule being centered around (1 1 1) However say we increase the distance between the hydrogen atoms We now have altered the molecule in such a way that the properties of that molecule has changed What did we change We simply changed the bond length one variable We increased the distance between the two atoms by some length R With Z-matrices we keep tabs on internal coordinates bond length (R) bond angle (A) and torsional/dihedral angle (T/D) Using internal coordinates reduces our 3N requirement set by the Cartesian space down to a 3N-6 requirement (for non-linear molecules) For linear molecules we keep tabs on 3N-5 coordinates When performing complex computations the less you have to keep track of the less expensive the computation Symmetry Consider the following molecule H2O We know from experience that this molecule has C2V symmetry The OH bond lengths should be equivalent When using some sort of optimizing routine you may want to specify symmetry in your system With a Z-matrix the process is very straightforward You would construct your Z-matrix to define the OH(1) bond as being equivalent to the OH(2) bond Whatever program you use should automatically recognize the constraint and will optimize your molecule accordingly giving you an answer based off a structure that is constrained to C2v symmetry With Cartesian space this is not guaranteed Rounding errors can cause your program to break symmetry or your program may not be very good at guessing the point group of your molecule based on the Cartesian coordinates alone Picking the Right One As a preface programs like Gaussian convert your Cartesian coordinate space (or your pre-defined Z-matrix) into redundant internal coordinates before proceeding with an optimization routine unless you specify it to stick with Cartesians or your Z-matrix I warn you that specifying your program to optimize using Cartesian coordinates makes your calculation much more expensive I find that I will explicitly specify 'Z-matrix' when I know I'm dealing with high symmetry and when I know my Z-matrix is perfect You will want to use Z-matrices on systems that are rather small If dealing with systems with high symmetry Z-matrices are almost essential They can be rather tricky to implement and you will likely spend some time figuring out the proper form of your Z-matrix through trial-and-error If you wish to scan a particular coordinate Z-matrices are also very helpful as you can tell a program to scan across a bond length angle or torsion with ease (as long as you've properly defined that coordinate in your Z-matrix) I use Cartesian coordinates for large systems systems with very little or no symmetry or when I'm in a hurry
4193,chemistry,What you're describing is thermoluminescence which is used as a paleochronology method (aka Trapped Electron (TE) dating afaik) The wikipedia article has a good synopsis Simply electrons get bound to potential wells generated in the radiation-defected structure When you heat the crystal up you allow it to anneal and return to a more regular structure The defected crystal is stuck in an energetic local minimum You can also do this trick with X-rays Calcite (or was it aragonite ) exposed to X-rays will turn light blue for a while
4524,chemistry,This difference between living and non-living polymerizations is small in words but large in effects In principle cationic and anionic polymerizations can be living In practice it is not as easy as it looks on paper See below A living polymerization is any chain (or addition) polymerization that is prevented from terminating i e the ends of the chains are still reactive In a living polymerization chain initiation has one initiation and propagation continues as long as there is monomer Termination (almost) never happens If your polymerization stops because your monomer runs out adding more monomer restarts the process and the existing chains get longer The number of chains formed matches very closely with the number of equivalents of initiator and the length of the chains depends on the ratio of monomer to initiator Most chain polymerizations (radical anionic cationic transition-metal insertion and ring-opening) do not behave this way There is a mechanism for termination that becomes increasingly kinetically favored as the concentration of free monomer decreases Sadly the wikipedia article for chain termination is pretty sad Most chain polymerizations propagate and terminate quickly with termination usually initiating the next chain Thus in a non-living polymerization new chains are constantly being initiated and old chains are constantly terminating until their is no more monomer In these cases adding additional monomer later would not accomplish anything because the chain ends are dead Experimental evidence for this phenomenon includes the formations of more chains than there were equivalents of initiator The length of the chain is more dependent on the relative rates of propagation and termination than on the initial ratio of monomer to initiator For radical polymerization termination mechanisms include fragmentation by &beta;-hydrogen abstraction or by recombination Both of these mechanisms are inherent in the radical nature of the polymerization and so are not preventable by exclusion of other species Radical polymerizations are made living by the addition of species that protect the radical at the end of the chain to prevent it from terminating Examples include ATRP and RAFT The wikipedia articles for both are pretty good For cationic polymerization termination mechanisms include &beta;-hydrogen abstraction chain transfer and attack by nucleophiles like water In principle a cationic polymerization could be a living polymerization if great pains were taking to exclude all species which might induce termination In practice this is doable but difficult as termination by chain transfer is always possible See the wikipedia article on living cationic polymerization The article is not great but suggests that cationic polymerizations done in nonpolar solutions (not in bulk) with nonnucleophilic Br&oslash;nsted or Lewis acids at low temperatures can become living polymerization For anionic polymerization termination mechanisms include protonation by protic molecules chain transfer and reaction with electrophiles which can include O 2 in some reactions Like cationic polymerizations anionic polymerizations can be made living by rigorous exclusion of terminating species Again this is difficult due to the possibility of chain transfer termination However with the correct choice of conditions it is doable as suggested by the wikipedia page for living anionic polymerizations Another way to accomplish some anionic polymerizations in a living fa

4219,chemistry,A general rule is crap goes in crap comes out A large-sample low-field 1D NMR at room temperature is usually only minimally affected by using a cheap NMR tube There are important differences though and I'll highlight a few The first distinction between prices is what the tube is constructed from quartz obviously costs more than borosilicate Why would a chemist ever use the more expensive quartz You can heat/cool quartz faster (nice for thermal studies) the UV cutoff is lower (think 190 nm opposed to 320nm) which is important for photolysis you can work with quartz at higher temperatures (around 1300 deg C instead of 250 C) and the purity of quartz is better controlled than your typical pyrex There are different grades of quartz fused and synthetic and there are different grades of borosilicate such as the high-quality pyrex or the lower-quality Class B each comes with its own limitations as far as purities are concerned and so forth Three more important parameters have to do with the manufacturing of your tube are concentricity camber and wall thickness Lower quality tubes will tend to have less precision &amp; accuracy over each of these parameters and as a result your sample may wobble while spinning (introducing problems such as modulation sidebands) A particularly bad tube can hit your RF coils and cause damage to your probe over time slowly or quickly if it is ignoring any reasonable standard -- even more apparent for a tube at this level of quality is that it may be easier to break while acquiring your sample and we all should be aware of how much fun that is for everybody involved Shimming can deal with impurities present in the glass (such as ferric oxide) and increased impurities in the glass/inhomogeneities will result in taking longer to get a good shim Time is money A lot of these things have lower tolerances in more complex experiments and at higher fields It really does depend on your particular experiment and what you're hoping to get out of it
4227,chemistry,This reference indicates that primary bonds in a polymer are the intramolecular bonds (the covalent bonds) that hold the polymer together Cross-linking different chains of polymer together does occur through a covalent bond such as a disulfide bond The secondary bonds that help to give the polymer its physical properties are intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding for polymers that contain hydroxyl or primary or secondary amine groups These secondary bonds can be disrupted by changing solvent conditions or heating for example which wouldn't disrupt the primary bonds So I suppose that you could say loosely that there are two kinds of bonds between polymers in solid material if you mean between the polymer chains before they have an opportunity to cross-link (by a change in pH for example) After they cross-link the physical properties of the bulk sample of the polymer will still be affected by secondary bonds the intermolecular interactions between the cross-linked chains The primary bonds will be stronger and can only be affected by chemical changes the secondary bonds (intermolecular forces) can be affected by changing the physical conditions
4223,chemistry,This answer to this question applies to your query Many physical properties depend on the intermolecular forces experienced in the liquid or solid These intermolecular forces are hydrogen bonding (strongest) dipole-dipole attractions (in polar molecules) and London dispersion forces (weakest of the forces when comparing molecules of the same size but dependent on the number of electrons in the substance) Stronger intermolecular forces would make the substance less volatile As noted in the first response methanol is more volatile than ethanol Methanol and ethanol would both have both hydrogen bonding (a relatively strong type of dipole-dipole attraction) and London dispersion forces Because ethanol has more electrons (because it is a bigger molecule but not necessarily because it is a heavier molecule) it would have more London dispersion forces in comparison to methanol so with stronger intermolecular forces it would be less volatile So this example follows the general guidelines--figure out the intermolecular forces present in the molecules you want to compare and the molecule with the weakest cumulative intermolecular forces will be the most volatile Intramolecular bonding (covalent bonds when you're talking about molecules) does not affect physical properties
4224,chemistry,The 2 refers to DOT (Department of Transportation) hazard class 2 This reference describes the different DOT hazard classes As summarized in the comments Class 2 (compressed gas) is divided into three subclasses (2 1 - flammable 2 2 - non-flammable non-toxic and 2 3 - toxic) I imagine the diamonds for Class 2 don't contain the subclass number because there is a different diamond colour/symbology for each subclass (as opposed to for instance 5 1 (oxidising agent) and 5 2 (organic peroxide) which have the same symbol and colours)
4229,chemistry,Look carefully it's (distorted) tetrahedral--four groups at nearly symmetrically positions in 3D space{*} So the hybridization is $sp^3$ As you can see the shape is distorted but it's tetrahedral Technically the banana bonds can be said to be made up of orbitals similar to $sp^3$ but not exactly (like two $sp^{3 1}$ and two $sp^{2 9}$ orbitals--since hybridization is just addition of wavefunctions we can always change the coefficients to give proper geometry) I'm not too sure of this though $\ce{B}$ has an $2s^22p^1$ valence shell so three covalent bonds gives it an incomplete octet $\ce{BH3}$ has an empty $2p$ orbital This orbital overlaps the existing $\ce{B-H}$ $\sigma$ bond cloud (in a nearby $\ce{BH3}$) and forms a 3c2e bond It seems that there are a lot more compounds with 3c2e geometry I'd completely forgotten that there were entire homologous series' under 'boranes' which all have 3c2e bonds (though not the same structure) And there are Indium and Gallium compounds as well Still group IIIA though these are metals I guess they like $\ce{Al}$ still form covalent bonds So the basic reason for this happening is due to an incomplete octet wanting to fill itself Note that banana is not necessarily only for 3c2e bonds Any bent bond is called a banana bond Regarding similar structures $\ce{BeCl2}$ and $\ce{AlCl3}$ come to mind but both of them have the structure via dative(coordinate) bonds Additionally $\ce{BeCl2}$ is planar Sneaks off and checks Wikipedia Wikipedia says $\ce{Al2(CH3)6}$ is similar in structure and bond type I guess we have less such compounds because there are comparatively few elements ($\ce{B}$ group pretty much) with $\leq3$ valence electrons which form covalent bonds(criteria for the empty orbital) Additionally $\ce{Al}$ is an iffy case--it like both covalent and ionic bonds Also for this geometry (either by banana bonds or by dative bonds) I suppose the relative sizes matter as well--since $\ce{BCl3}$ is a monomer even though $\ce{Cl}$ has a lone pair and can form a dative bond *Maybe you're used to the view of tetrahedral structure with an atom at the top Mentally tilt the boron atom till a hydrogen is up top You should realize that this is tetrahedral as well
4234,chemistry,In short the definition of a chemical bond is not unique and a clearly-drawn line The simplest and most common definition is the sharing of electrons between two or more nuclei In contrast other interactions are often said to be intermolecular (which is somewhat more specific than the term “physical” In a longer commentary I see can have five different types of definition of the chemical bond (vs intermolecular interactions) Let's start from the beginning in this case using the words of Linus Pauling winner of the 1954 Nobel Prize for “determining the nature of the chemical bond linking atoms into molecules” In The Nature of the Chemical Bond (1960) he gives the following definition            A bond is what links atoms into molecules and molecules are defined at the discretion of the chemist You can find the same definition still in use in some high-school textbooks but it isn't very helpful… The complete opposite consider all interactions as chemical bonds whose strenght can vary I actually hadn't heard that one before I researched textbooks to write this answer but you can find it in some textbooks like this one              This view has some grounding because all interatomic interactions stem from the behaviour of the system's electrons (in addition to nuclei–nuclei Coulombic forces) However it does not allow to make a strong distinction between interactions whose energies differ by orders of magnitude Chemists like molecules and they like categorizing things between intra- and inter-molecular as it's a nice model (making it easier for our mind to handle) You can classify interactions by energy decide that chemical bonds are those interactions that have an energy higher than a certain threshold let's say 50 kJ/mol This makes things clean and makes sure that you can easily classify interactions However the choice of a threshold is problematic Finally what I believe is the most common description is to look at the nature of the interaction and classify it following a certain convention The two other answers so far have focused on this part and listed the various “usual” types of bonds and intermolecular interactions so I won't say more on that I said five types right Well the fifth is mine of course Not only mine but that of the New Oxford American Dictionary as well which I quite like chemical bond a strong force of attraction holding atoms together in a molecule or crystal resulting from the sharing or transfer of electrons Short and powerful What I like in that is that it gives a general prescription allowing one to argue individual cases and not based too much on convention What are the features of a chemical bond Well it has to be an attractive force between atoms sure… but I think the most relevant criterion of all is sharing (or transfer) of electrons That is after all what chemistry is about description of electronic clouds around two or more atoms And I think when this criterion is applied to the list of interaction types commonly classified it works quite well (whithout being dogmatic) Also what I like in it is that a given interaction type can be considered one way or another depending on its strength The best
4237,chemistry,The answer appears to be right there in the linked synthesis details - the nickel is non-catalytic and is only there to generate a passivated surface that won't degrade in the high-temperature fluorine atmosphere [Edit] The plot thickens this paper suggests that xenon may in fact abstract fluorine off the passivated nickel fluoride surface due to observed zeroth order kinetics which lends some serious credence to jonsca's original inference of Ni being catalytic This will take some more investigation
4339,chemistry,Classical hybridization theory does not allow for noninteger hybridizations However ab initio calculations can be interpreted using a bond order analysis method such as NBO where the MO coefficients are used to provide the closest analogue possible to a classical hybridization picture For example one of the pure $sp$ orbitals in Pauling's valence bond theory (where hybridization was first introduced) has wavefunction $$ \phi_{sp} = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \phi_{s} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \phi_{p_x} $$ Taking the square of the coefficients this orbital is $\frac 1 2$ s character and $\frac 1 2$ p character i e it is an $sp$ orbital The basic idea of a bond order analysis method is to reexpress a molecular orbital into a form similar to $$ \phi = c_1 \phi_{As} + c_2 \phi_{Ap_x} + c_3 \phi_{Ap_y} + c_4 \phi_{Ap_z} + \dots$$ If the other coefficients are very small the ratio $$ n = \frac {c_2^2 + c_3^2 + c_4^2}{c_1^2} $$ would yield a number that could be used interpret $\phi$ as a $sp^n$ orbital on atom $A$ Edit As for inferring hybridization states from a direct inspection of nuclear geometries there is in principle no such direct relationship in electronic structure theories that are more sophisticated than VSEPR The former is an electronic property whereas the spatial arrangement of atomic nuclei are not and the relationship between the two becomes much more complicated
4334,chemistry,What you describe is unfortunately a very common misconception Defining orbitals does not break spatial symmetry It is still completely arbitrary which directions you define as $x$ $y$ and $z$ and thus it is entirely arbitrary how you orient the $2p$ orbitals in space Therefore rotational invariance is still preserved The other thing to remember is that all the $p$ orbitals are (essentially) degenerate and so you can take any linear superposition of them you want For example you can write down an orbital that looks like $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\phi_{2p_x}+\phi_{2p_y}+\phi_{2p_z}\right) $$ and placing an electron in this orbital does not break rotational symmetry
4241,chemistry,If your compound has been synthesized before you can measure its optical activity and compare it with the data in the literature If your compound hasn't been synthesized before it can be possible to differentiate between two enantiomers with NMR by measuring the spectra of your molecule in a chiral environment Here's a review article on how to resolve enantiomers with NMR Otherwise diastereomers can be differentiated easily By looking at your molecule you can (sort of) predict which spectrum it should give rise to by using the concepts of enantiotopic homotopic heterotopic and diastereotopic protons We had to analyse and solve 2D-NMR spectra ( 1 H and 13 C) of diastereomers last year and to a beginner I have to say it was a challenge As always it boils down to forming diastereomers EDIT Take a look at these diasteromers Without getting into much detail (I've got finals coming up) it's easy to see that the hydroxyl will shift the ethyl's CH 2 peaks towards lower field (higher ppm) in the second isomer The interpretation of chiral media NMR spectra would have to be similar My impression is that the acquisition of chiral media spectra is more involved but the interpretation isn't I might be totally off track though Someone might want to share a more thorough answer
8555,chemistry,So I ask what are the trends leading to the brittleness of a metal Brittle materials absorb very little energy before fracturing The only trend that can be linked to this is the strength of bonding in the metal (Other factors like crystal structure and purity do not have any trends and so there are a lot of exceptions) This also means that the trend in brittleness is not very regular since it is complex and depends on too many other factors why are these trends there (usually trends can be explained in terms of simpler things like atomic size/sheilding/etc) Since brittleness cannot be explained by a very simple trend I will explain what reasons I have found The stronger the bonding in the metal the more difficult it is to change its structure and thus it tends to break instead of deforming Here's a graph (melting point vs Group number) that gives a general measure of strength of metallic bonding in all the transition elements of the first three series According to the graph we predict that Tungsten (Period 6 Group VIB) should the most brittle and this is true for impure tungsten Again this successfully predicts that Silver Gold and Copper (Group IB) are least brittle (and so most malleable and ductile) Also Lanthanum (Period 6 Group IIIB) is predicted to be quite malleable and this is also true Note that this also explains the high malleability of alkali metals (the graph is not very clear at that point) There may be much more exceptions to this trend when examined closely so take this only as an approximation Crystal structures also play an important role in brittleness but they cannot be explained by a trend Purity of a metal tends to increase malleability and decrease brittleness because there are less points at which a fracture can take place
4244,chemistry,This can be done by first reating the phenol with $\ce{HNO2}$ Which gives us this Then reacting with dil $\ce{HNO3}$ we get 90% yield of para nitro phenol This happens because $\ce{N=O}$ has a very strong $- I$ effect thus it concentrates the electrons more towards the para position so on reacting with dil $\ce{HNO3}$ we get max yield of para P S - Another way of getting only para is using a protecting agent but i cant recall the reaction now I will post it later
4247,chemistry,I'd really reccomend the free Marvin suite from ChemAxon MarvinSketch (the actual drawing package) hasn't disappointed me in the past and has a wide feature set In addition to just being able to draw compounds in Lewis format the software includes plugins to name what you have drawn (systematic/traditional) predict properties change atom and bond properties generate stereoisomers and much more that I haven't got the experience to do anything more than experiment with You can view what you have drawn in Lewis form and also as a 3D structure should you wish to It supports many chemical drawing filetypes Here is the product page including brochure and technical details It is Java based so works on Mac Windows Linux and is even available on the web (but is quite slow to generate properties etc - I'd reccomend doing this locally)
4371,chemistry,The signals you get in a simple 1D proton spectrum are in most cases roughly quantitative though there are some exceptions and some aspects you need to consider if you need high accuracy Acquisition There are several things you need to keep in mind while setting up the experiment to ensure that the resulting NMR spectrum will be quantitative The spectrum should be of high quality any artifacts and noise will affect the quantification Relaxation delay The relaxation delay is the time between experiments if it is too short some protons won't relax completely back to the equilibrium state This affects the intensity of the NMR signal and will cause the integrals of those signals to be off The relaxation delay (including the acquisition time) should be around $5 \cdot \mathrm{T_1}$ You can either estimate the $\mathrm{T_1}$ or measure it 13 C satellites The 13 C satellites are around 1% of the total signal if you need high accuracy you should use decoupling to get rid of those Other aspects You also need to ensure that the pulses used in the experiment have a reasonably flat excitation profile for the area you're looking at This is usually no problem for standard 1D proton experiments but might be a problem for other kinds of experiments or if you have an unusually long pulse and/or and unusually wide distribution of your chemical shifts Processing Baseline The baseline should be absolutely flat and at exactly zero any error there will lead to large errors in the quantification Using a digital filter during acquisition is a good idea for that ( baseopt option for Bruker spectrometers) this will ensure a very flat baseline at zero as long as no other problems distort the baseline Phasing The phase-correction should be exact it might be necessary to perform a manual phase-correction
4251,chemistry,Well your question is equivalent to “what is it about ?-diazoketones that makes them so much more stable ” which is easier to see Compared to an alkyldiazo the ?-diazoketone has a resonance structure in which the negative charge goes to the ketone’s oxygen (and far away from the positively-charged nitrogen atom) Because the oxygen is a quite electronegative element the resonance form is quite stable and explains the extra stability of ?-diazoketones It is for the same reason that the protons in position ? to the ketones are always more acidic than alky chain protons Coming back to alkyldiazo compounds you have to realize that merely being able to write a resonance structure does not intrinsically imply stabilization the resonance structure has to have some intrinsic stability factor In the alkyldiazo the resonance form you wrote is a carbanion which is considered quite unfavourable unless it has a further stabilizing factor Moreover the most common reactions gives N 2 which is a very stable compound… the reaction is thermodynamically very favourable
4253,chemistry,According to the MSDS for Jet Dry (a common brand name) it contains Sodium 2-phenylpropane-2-sulfonate (Sodium cumene sulfonate) Propane-1 2-diol Citric acid I think it may be safe to assume that the citric acid is in there for a clean smell and also to soften the water (thanks to the commenter) The sulfonate is presumably a surfactant to help break the surface tension of the water and promote evaporation and the propylene glycol may help serve as a coolant (and is favored due to low toxicity)
4265,chemistry,Determining the rate of the kinetics of a reaction isn't done with only one measurement or looking at only one graph What zero order kinetics means is that the rate of the reaction is independent of the concentration of chemical species To determine the kinetics of a process you need to take a series of measurements while altering one variable namely the concentration of one of the chemical species under investigation In zero order kinetics you should observe that as you change the concentration of reactant for example the rate of the reaction remains constant
4268,chemistry,Here's a draft First read this paper Considering we're under alkaline conditions (blood pH between 7 35-7 45) we'll take their alkaline mechanism proposal Mechanism This is obviously incomplete with good reason Without knowing what the active site of the enzyme looks like (except for Ser70) it's difficult to devise of a mechanism I could imagine another alkoxy attacking the sp 3 carbon between S and N and shifting two electrons to the sulfur thus generating your SO 2 - in one step but that would require a proper active site The geometry of the molecule inside the active site of the enzyme is obviously optimal for this reaction to proceed I'd like to know more For some reason my school doesn't give me access to this paper
4274,chemistry,I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for (it may well still be too abstract) but oscillations can occur in the Gray-Scott system which is $$&#xD; A + 2B \to 3B\\&#xD; B \to P &#xD; $$ where $P$ is an inert product and the reaction is assumed to take place in a flow reactor that provides a supply of A giving rise to the dynamics $$&#xD; \frac{da}{dt} = f(1-a) - ab^2;\\&#xD; \frac{db}{dt} = ab^2 - (f+k)b \\&#xD; $$ where $f$ is a rate determined by the flow reactor $k$ is the rate of the $B\to P$ reaction and the rate constant of the autocatalytic reaction has been set to 1 without loss of generality by scaling $f$ and $k$ relative to it With the appropriate choice of the parameters $f$ and $k$ oscillation can happen because $B$'s concentration increases autocatalytically but then it overshoots its food source (i e the concentration of A) which then builds up again allowing the cycle to repeat You might not like the trimolecular step but I've found you generally get similar behaviour if you split it up into something like $$&#xD; A + B \to C + B\\&#xD; B + C \to 2B\\&#xD; B \to P &#xD; $$ (Simply using $A+B\to 2B$ doesn't work because its kinetics don't have the right sort of nonlinearity ) I would say that this has an advantage over the Ball model that you posted in that it obeys the laws of thermodynamics (At least from what you showed in your question it looks to me that Ball's model only oscillates because the reverse reactions have been neglected and if they weren't then it would have to go to equilibrium because it's a closed system ) It makes explicit that you need a power source (the supply of $A$) for oscillation and illustrates the connection between oscillatory behaviour and autocatalytic kinetics
4516,chemistry,I think your problem with this reaction lies in the easily confused term syn and cis Both appear to mean that two functional groups are oriented in the same direction On a cyclic molecule syn and cis are the same However cis is a stereochemical descriptor and syn is a conformational descriptor Simplifying this reaction to an acyclic case may help Consider the meso isomer of 2 3-butanediol shown This isomer is drawn in the anti conformation which is probably the lowest energy for steric reasons This isomer has a syn conformation which looks like the following Note that the two -OH groups are not both oriented forward with solid wedges That drawing implies a high energy eclipsed conformation Now back to the reaction with HIO 4 In order to form the cyclic intermediate the -OH groups need to be close in space On an acyclic molecule this requires a syn conformation which most acyclic molecules can achieve even if it is not the lowest energy conformation In cyclic molecules particularly cyclohexanes the syn conformation might not have the -OH groups close together For cis -1 2-cyclohexanediol which is also syn respective to the plane of the ring to move the two -OH groups into the correct arrangement it would need to wiggle into the higher energy boat or twist-boat conformations However trans -1 2-cyclohexanediol which is anti has the two -OH groups oriented close together In a sense the trans isomer has the two -OH groups oriented syn with respect to the C-C bond that they share Thus trans -1 2-cyclohexanediol should react more readily with HIO 4 that cis -1 2-cyclohexanediol because the lowest energy conformer of trans -1 2-cyclohexanediol has the close arrangement of two -OH groups The cis isomer would have to change conformation which increases the energy input required increasing the activation energy and slowing the reaction rate The diaxial case (whether boat or chair) would definitely be unreactive
4273,chemistry,Partition Coefficient P = [Organic] / [Aqueous] Where [] = concentration and Log P= log10 (Partition Coefficient) if log P value is higher then its more lipophilic ;those drugs were more absorbed by cells and elimination of those drugs from body will be less The partition coefficient is a ratio of concentrations of un-ionized compound between the two solutions so for a chemical which is having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends also have log P values Eg Oleic acid Log P = 7 64 chemicals which are hydrophopic(lipophilic) tends to have more Log P values and hydrophilic(lipophobic) chemicals have less log P eg pentane(log P=3 45)[lipohilic] 1-pentanol (log P=1 51)[lipophobic]
4277,chemistry,Well sulfur in general and thiolates in particular are known for bonding very strongly to gold lead and mercury In the particular case of mercury which was known very early in the history of chemistry (indeed since the times of alchemy) this is the reason thiols are often called mercaptans from the Latin mercurium captans (capturing mercury) In Pearson's HSAB theory (hard and soft acids and bases) the reason the S-Hg bond is be stronger than the O-Hg can be explained because S 2- is a soft basis and Hg(II) is a soft acid making a good fit… while O 2- is harder Finally regarding the historical use of thiols to bind mercury (and lead to) let's just say a chelating agent for mercury and other toxic compounds was quite useful as an antidote You can read a very nice book on the historical use of mercury and lead in John Emsley's The Elements of Murder
4337,chemistry,Yes you need additional quantities beyond the minimum necessary for calculating energies and the Hellmann-Feynman piece of the force when the wavefunction is not variational Here is a very rough sketch of why Puláy forces arise from applying the chain rule for calculating forces and was first discussed in the context of applying the Hellman-Feynman theorem Recall that the force is the change of energy with changes in (nuclear) coordinate and the energy is the expectation value of the (electronic) Hamiltonian $E = \left&lt;\psi\left|H\right|\psi\right&gt;$ Applying the chain rule to this $$-F = \nabla E = \left&lt;\psi \left\vert \nabla H \right\vert \psi\right&gt; + 2\left&lt; \nabla\psi \left\vert H \right\vert \psi\right&gt;$$ The first term is what you get from Hellman-Feynman and is the expectation of a one-electron operator of the first you have listed The second term goes away in Hellmann-Feynman only because it assumes the wavefunction is variational If you expand out the orbitals in the Slater determinant in some AO basis $\chi$ $$ \psi(r_1 r_2 r_N) = \phi(r_1) \wedge \phi(r_2) \wedge \dots \wedge \phi(r_N) $$ $$ \phi(r_1) = \sum_i c_i \chi_i(r_i) $$ then it is clear that $\nabla\psi$ generates terms which are MO coefficient derivatives (usually denoted $c_i^x$) and also AO derivatives ($\chi_i^x$) If the wavefunction were variational then by definition all these derivatives are zero If you work through the algebra you will find that there are some new quantities that need to be calculated in order to work out the non-Hellmann-Feynman theorem most notably the one-sided AO overlap derivative matrices $\left&lt;\chi_i^x\vert\chi_j\right&gt;$ which do not normally show up otherwise These terms turn out to be critical for getting correct ab initio molecular dynamics since the wavefunction is rarely (if ever) variational in time There are tricks one can do to reduce the cost of calculating MO coefficient derivatives but they cannot be obtained for free in general And there's really no way around calculating the overlap derivative terms
4291,chemistry,This can arise due to ion-ion interactions brought on by Coulombic fields A proper explanation is rooted in transport phenomena Unfortunately chemists are largely not taught this but chemical engineers do get the opportunity Under standard conditions ions in a solution will take a random walk during diffusion This results in no net movement of our ions over some span of time Such a system perturbed by an applied electric field will cause ions to preferentially move in one direction we say the ions will drift We say they have a drift velocity These velocities are affected by a number of parameters as there is still continual collision but we can say that the mobilities will be unequal for ions of unequal sizes Different mobilities mean concentration gradients form and charge separation too Typically we use an electroneutrality field as a reasonable approximation to allow analytic solutions for various equations This field depends on all the ionic fluxes present and as such will affect the total measurable current The result is simple the introduction of any ion will cause a perturbation in the field that all the ions encounter in solution
4288,chemistry,I don't have time to do the calculations manually but inputing your problem data into a chemical equilibrium software (here Dozzaqueux) reveals that the precipitate you observe is Pb(OH) 2 while no PbI 2 should form The former is white while the later is yellow; can you tell us what color was your precipitate
4292,chemistry,Yes along with a family of related methods I honestly don't fully understand the mechanics behind it but the orbitals obtained with the NBO method can be used for a treatment called Natural Resonance Theory which gives you an idea of what sort of Lewis-structure resonance components there are and in what weightings as well as bond indices and a measure of covalency There are three papers from the developers of the technique covering theory usage and some more examples (I'd probably start with the usage paper ) Also along with NBO there are the Natural Atomic Orbitals which are often lumped in because they're also computed by the NBO program and Natural Population Analysis which you can use the Natural Atomic Orbitals to do These give you an idea of what sort of atomic orbital character is contributing to your molecular orbitals and also atomic charges and net spins
4287,chemistry,Yes a 2D-periodic space can be mapped to a torus but that's more a question for the math SE … Regarding your bonus question why would there be What would you do with it Molecular structures are intrinsically 3D so I don't see what you would do in a 2D (periodic or not) space Even when we talk about planar or pseudo-2D structures (buckyball nanotube etc ) they are 3D objects with 3D electronic densities and wavefunctions Edit 3D structures that are periodic in two dimensions and finite in the other one can be studied by many computational chemistry codes They are often referred to as slab calculations or surface calculations The most common issue is that of Coulombic interaction (or Poisson equation solver) which typically requires special treatment in the 2D case
4323,chemistry,Is this even how GC/MS results work As cbeleites said the method you described is a proper technique but not likely to be appropriate given the information you cited In GC/MS you should have two sets of information The first is the GC Total Ion Chromatograph (TIC) which will have time as the x-axis and response (abundance) as the y-axis For each retention time on the TIC there will be a corresponding Mass Spectra (MS) In the MS the x-axis is m/z (ion) and y-axis is also response (abundance) Different compounds have different responses so if you inject the exact same amount of two different compounds you could get a much larger response from one compared to the other For example tramadol gives much higher response compared to hydrocodone This is why you want your internal standard to be structurally similar to your analyte Quantification of a compound is often done by running 3 - 5 calibrators at known concentrations in order to make a calibration curve Once an acceptable calibration curve is made the sample along with controls can be fit onto the curve to calculate the amount of the compound of interest in the sample and controls If the controls are correct then the sample value can be used To make a calibration curve you need an internal standard in each calibrator control and sample You can then make the curve either with ion ratios between paired internal standard and analyte ions OR if your internal standard response is consistent in all the calibrators controls and sample you can use the GC peak response In conclusion if you only have one GC/MS run with the two dissimilar compounds in it you will not be able to easily calculate the quantity of the second compound based on the GC response of the first unless you have additional information that was not listed in this question
4805,chemistry,I can't tell if the modifier formal applies only to definition or to algorithm also in the first sentence of your question's body In case any algorithm would do this looks like a pretty standard instance of the cycle-detection problem that one learns in undergraduate computer science If you only want to detect the presence of cycles then the algorithm is essentially just to attempt a topological sorting of the graph; if the attempt fails you have a cycle and I guess that would mean that you have some sort of catalysis going on (I didn't major in chemistry; please yell at me if that's non sequitur ) Okay so mere cycles are not enough - it seems you want cycles that have gain How about a tortoise and hare and have these multiply a state variable by the ratio of outgoing to incoming edges to reaction nodes (denoted by squares in your diagram) If the hare catches up to the tortoise that implies a cycle hence catalysis; then if you compare their state if the hare has accumulated a larger gain than the tortoise I would say that that shows the presence of autocatalysis I'm not sure how this works if there are multiple linked cycles You could have one cycle in your graph that's autocatalytic and another cycle linked to it that uses up its catalyst (something of a contradiction) For example B + C -&gt; D + E A + D + H -&gt; 2C + F 2F + G -&gt; H Is that still an autocatalytic system
4352,chemistry,Suffice to say nobody really knows and a Nobel prize surely awaits the first people who can explain the relationship between chemical composition and high-temperature superconductivity
4296,chemistry,You cannot have bond angles of 0 or 180 degrees in a Z-matrix This is because the dihedral becomes degenerate To solve this you can add ' dummy atoms ' which provide an auxiliary point of reference to remove the 180 degree angle These atoms are usually denoted $\ce{X}$ or $\ce{Xx}$ in computational chemistry suites Usually dummy atoms are placed at 90 degrees to a pair of atoms and the third collinear atom is then defined with a bond angle of 90 degrees and a dihedral of 0 or 180 degrees with respect to the previous 3 atoms Example To illustrate what I'm talking about here's a schematic of your pair of molecules with three dummy atoms This could have a Z-matrix like O 1 C 1 a Xx 2 1 0 1 90 O 2 b 3 90 1 180 Xx 4 1 0 2 90 3 0 H 4 c 5 90 2 180 Xx 6 1 0 4 90 5 0 O 6 d 7 90 4 180 H 8 e 6 104 5 7 180 Notes There are no hard and fast rules about how many you should use (obviously we could simply define subsequent dihedrals in terms of the leftmost dummy atom) however it's best to strive for locality so that small changes in some variable don't correspond to large displacements elsewhere in which case rounding errors or large gradients can ruin your day You could also have defined all of the dihedrals in your molecule with respect to that convenient non-collinear hydrogen however this is the Z-matrix equivalent of spaghetti code You will note that I use different letters for each variable This is because forcing the $\ce{H-O}$ and $\ce{C=O}$ bonds to be of equal length is probably an unrealistic constraint for a geometry optimisation of this system Finally note that dummy atoms do not take part in the electronic structure of a molecule so feel free to put them in anywhere and set the dummy atom 'bond' length to whatever you want 1 0 Ångström is traditional as far as I know P S Molden has a complete if idiosyncratic graphical Z-matrix editor
4588,chemistry,I've searched for this same data My interest regards electronic proporties of zeolite-class media I've written this same kind of question on Quora I think the reason this is rarely answered and why there are no 'catalogs' is several-fold There exist a wide range of applications based on the composition of the water / etc The treatment media usually varies in composition meaning that no directive for the use of a zeolite product can be given by a sales rep (only on-staff engineers who know how to use it) Some uses create by-products that are regulated creating possible liabilities for the seller by indicating a fitness-for-use Regulations change; per year per locale etc I think the groups that know about these are environmental engineering firms whom have a stable of engineers that provide end-to-end services for their clientele Many of of these firms have Chemists on-staff or a consultancy relationship that suits the same They know the chemical properties of their media and need a zeolite / catalysts that can effect something very specific As a result they're out their hunting the journals for something that targets their needs Hard to out-sell that without already having a dog in the game
4305,chemistry,For those who have never had the pleasure of personally doing this see this video It has been known since 1807 that dissolving sodium in liquid ammonia results in a beautiful color It was originally thought the color was due to some familiar complex instead of a solvated electron A similar phenomenon happens with other alkali metals in ammonia Research in the field says that it takes at least forty some ammonia molecules to solvate a given electron Metstable cavities form and their stability could depend highly on electrostatic interactions to solvate our electron Ammonia will slowly react by evolving hydrogen gas $$\ce{ 2NH_3 + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2 + 2NH_2 ^-}$$ Differences in solvent can play a huge role in the stability of our solvated electron An analogous decomposition occurs in water $$\ce{ 2H_2O + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2 + 2 HO^- }$$ Famously the latter occurs faster than the former see here in comparison to my earlier link We could say that these differences in rate reflect different stabilities of our solvated electron Although the addition of an appropriate catalyst to our ammonia will result in rapid evolution of hydrogen A more quantitative description for the difference in energies is obtained by measuring the UV-vis spectrum for a solvated electron in both water and ammonia One will quickly notice that the band appears at higher energies in water than it does in ammonia and there are considerable differences in the band shapes (the band is wider in ammonia) So Why Do They Differ So here I have to make the disclaimer that no current theories quantitatively reproduce the observed phenomena such as the absorption spectrum for a solvated electron This question has no established/accepted answer as it is an ongoing area of research The self-ionization of water has an equilibrium constant on the order of K = $10^{-14}$ and that of ammonia is on the order of $10^{-30}$ Hydronium formation occurs in the case of water and ammonium in the case of ammonia Hydronium has a considerably lower pKa than ammonium and so it's reasonable to see why a reaction in water would be more likely with an electron (Ammonia rarely produces a weakly acidic species but water often produces a strongly acidic complex ) A slightly deeper reason may be that water forms more ordered local domains/structures in solution than ammonia and this influences the rate by resulting in a larger entropy of activation when the hydrolyzed electron breaks up these larger structures recall that $k \propto \exp (\Delta S ^\ddagger /R) $ Just speculation though
4302,chemistry,To understand why the exclusion principle isn't violated in this system you really need to shift from valence bond theory to molecular orbital theory The $p_{z}$ orbitals in benzene combine according to the $D_{6h}$ symmetry of the molecule to generate a set of bonding molecular orbitals (MOs) (which are lower in energy than the isolated $p_{z}$ orbitals) and a set of antibonding molecular orbitals (which are higher in energy) Bonding orbitals are generated from sets of $p_{z}$ orbitals which are mostly or totally in phase whereas the highest energy antibonding orbital of the set is composed of $p_{z}$ orbitals that are totally out of phase with respect to their adjacent neighbors Here for instance is the MO that is generated from the totally in-phase set (I calculated this at a spin-restricted RI-BP86/6-311G* level of theory in ORCA (1) and visualised the isosurfaces in VMD (2) ) Now this MO is shared equally across all of the carbons i e it is not localised However it only contains 2 electrons and thus satisfies the exclusion principle (F'x mentions spin-orbitals - this is where the orbitals are split on the basis of their spin which entails a single electron per orbital Benzene is a closed-shell singlet so we would expect the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ spin orbitals to be spatially indistinguishable ) Not to sound like a walking advertisment for Housecroft and Sharpe but H&amp;S has a great visual introduction to MO theory P S It was suggested in chat that I expand upon the generated orbitals - here's one of the two highest occupied molecular orbitals from the same calculation As you can see there's a big node along one of the mirror planes This orbital is higher in energy than the earlier example because it's composed of two antiphase sets of 3 $p_{z}$ orbitals so this orbital has antibonding character for two of the carbon-carbon pairs It should be easy to extrapolate to the highest lying MO of this type - antibonding all the way around (1) Neese F ORCA – an ab initio Density Functional and Semiempirical program package Version 2 6 University of Bonn 2008 (2) Humphrey W Dalke A and Schulten K 'VMD - Visual Molecular Dynamics' J Molec Graphics 1996 14 1 33-38
4301,chemistry,First Wikipedia doesn't really say what is the extent of this change Here are superimposed a benzene and a benzyne molecule (own HF calculation don't ask for the details) The carbon atoms involved in the triple bond are displaced by less than 0 2 Å In benzene we have with this level of calculation C–C distance = 1 39 Å C–H distance = 1 08 Å C–C–C angle = 120° while in benzyne we have C–C triple bond = 1 22 Å other C–C bonds = 1 38 Å (almost all equal) So merely because the triple bond is stronger the distance will be shorted and the benzyne structure is distorted Regarding orbitals well the p orbitals of the carbon atoms involved in the triple bond are “naturally” directed towards where the hydrogens would be Slightly distortion of the system is possible and indeed evidence above on the structure but they will not be parallel as that would disrupt the structure too much and diminish the $\sigma$ bond So it's a competition between making the new $p$ orbitals “more parallel” increases overlap but it weakens the $\sigma$ bonding pattern which is much stronger As such while some distortion happens you stay mostly close to the benzene-type orbitals
4311,chemistry,That diagram is misleading because it's technically in reference to bis(hexamethylbenzene)ruthenium(0) This is a famous example by the late and great E O Fischer This Ru(0) complex is 18e three methyl resonances were observed for the bent ring at -10 C$^{\text{o}}$ Crystallography later confirmed this This structure is surprising to the new student perhaps because the classic 18e bis(benzene)chromium is sandwiched between two planar arenes This is not an organic chemistry question It is deep in the realm of organometallic chemistry with a proper explanation requiring a molecular orbital energy diagram and then one has to invoke a Jahn Teller instability argument that requires lowering symmetry from $D_{6d}$ or $D_{6h}$ Suffice it to say stability is increased by changing the hapticity
4309,chemistry,I am an Australian English speaker and yes this distinction is made in practice Possibly the only reasonable opportunity to use the p?? pronunciation in the name of a compound is in the case of the entertaining molecule periodane which is actually named after the periodic table This molecule (and later a number of different plausible isomers) was identified computationally by a methodology called 'mindless chemistry' which optimises randomly generated molecular graphs Periodane is a stable configuration of each atom on the second row of the periodic table with the exception of neon (although some people are working on that)

4370,chemistry,Juha invited me to write a summary (see comment on my previous answer ) of the differences between melting and dissolving I’ll try to outline this roughly in the same order as his I'm giving this as a new answer since my last answer was quite long as it was Differences Melting and dissolving are completely different processes on the molecular/atomic level that could not be mistaken for each other if you could observe what was happening at that scale If you cool the liquid that arose from melting the solid to a temperature below it’s melting point you would see the entire sample solidify If you cool the solution (dissolved solid + solute) to below the melting point of the solid (solute) in it you would see no change (Unless you had a saturated or nearly saturated solution ) Melting requires only a single substance and energy input while dissolving requires a solvent and a solute that are compatible (“like forces”) (This is actually a pretty huge difference and would potentially affect all of the physical and chemical properties ) Dissolving a solid can be either endo- or exo-thermic Phase change (wording from the previous summary) In each case you end up with a liquid Melting caused a phase change (composition of the substance didn’t change) while dissolving a solid in a liquid is not considered a phase change since a change in composition occurred Similarities In each case forces between the particles that comprise the solid are disrupted and that takes energy (Whether it’s chemical bonds or intermolecular forces depends on the process and on the solid and on your definitions ( See this question ) But melting (rare exception noted in previous comments) is endothermic and dissolving can be either endo- or exo-thermic In each case you end up with a liquid Macroscopically if you walked into a room and saw the liquid on the table it would be difficult to say whether this liquid came from a solid that had melted or a solid that had dissolved in a solute and made a solution But it would be very easy to determine which you had experimentally in a “dozen” different ways Both melting and dissolving require interaction among groups of atoms molecules or ions There are probably more differences that could be given (how to handle thermodynamic calculations complexity of the system etc ) and possibly more similarities but that's enough for me on this topic
4490,chemistry,I am not an expert in ICP-MS but an ICP-MS should be considered an ICP ion source coupled with a mass spectrometer There are some key issues raised by the coupling between both instruments due to the high temperature of the ICP source as well as due to the fact that one wants to analyse atomic ions and remove any interfering molecular ions (mostly oxides but other molecules and clusters are possible) Therefore to attempt an answer to your question the standard output of an ICP-MS will be presented as a mass spectrum (intensity versus m/z or intensity versus amu) There are a couple of sample spectra in the brochures published by instrument makers see for instance the Bruker brochure or a Thermo application note How this mass spectrum is obtained from the detector will lead to the type of data that is acquired For a quadrupole mass filter as well as for magnetic sector instruments two modes of operation are possible Either a single mass is selected and therefore ont will only get a trace of the abundance of a given mass as a function of time (chromatography or on-line sample analysis) Otherwise the mass filter can be scanned leading to a mass spectrum For time of flight detectors the mass spectrum is built by the measurement of a flight time for an ion to reach the detector Therefore the mass spectrum is converted from a time dependent signal to a spectrum Finally there have been some attempts to couple an ICP ion source with a Fourier transform mass spectrometer As far as I know these are not commercial instruments In such instruments the ions oscillate at m/z dependent frequencies and the recorded image current is converted to a spectrum through the use of Fourier transform
4377,chemistry,Toxicities are often greatly influenced by how you are exposed and in what dose Mercury is a fascinating metal You can find it as the pure metal a salt or in an organic form In its standard state it is a liquid and is rather volatile Large amounts are naturally released into the atmosphere but humans contribute as well for example burning fossil fuels such as coal will release it into the atmosphere The forms of mercury are not set in stone it is quite able to switch forms from the free metal to the salt to the organic by processes in nature Orally consuming some liquid metal isn't the worst possible route of exposure; mercury was at one time even used as a laxative The only absorption in the GI tact is thought to be due to mercury vapor Skin exposure is undesirable but we know that inhaling the vapor is more toxic because it is soluble in lipids Upon entering the bloodstream some makes it way past the blood/brain barrier (hence its neurotoxicity) and some is converted to Hg(II) by catalase Mercury's inorganic salts have a long useful history where some were used to treat syphilis some for lights and some for hat making and so on Mad as a hatter won its name due to chronic exposure to Hg(NO$_3$)$_2$ which was used in hat making This salt isn't very lipid soluble but more absorption does occur when swallowed than the free metal These salts tend to build up in the kidneys after absorption and high exposure will cause renal failure Not much will pass through the blood/brain barrier but chronic exposure will eventually allow some across and cause neurotoxicity They also tend to bind with proteins containing sulfur and this can cause some cell death As a general rule Hg(I) salts are less toxic than Hg(II) presumably due to the decreased solubility of Hg(I) This does not mean they cannot cause harm mercuric chloride was used in a factory and the wastes were discharged into a nearby sea anaerobic bacteria methylated the mercury this methylmercury was absorbed by fish that were later eaten and hurt many people As an organic mercury compounds tend to be considerably more lipid soluble and therefore can readily be absorbed or cross the blood/brain barrier in comparison to the free metal A terrible example is dimethylmercury which claimed the life of an inorganic chemist who was accidentally exposed to some she was using in an NMR experiment I do not know much about its amalgams aside from gold/silver I believe most of the toxicity was seen in gold refineries due to the fact that the amalgam is heated to remove the mercury which leaves behind gold and results in the release of mercury vapor
4315,chemistry,I'm not sure I completely understand what exactly your problem is but You want to resolve to signals at approx m/z = 1060 2 and m/z = 1061 2 So $\Delta m = 1$ The required resolution is $\frac{m}{\Delta m} = \frac{1061}{1} \approx 1060$ The spectrometer in (a) has only 1000 which is too low The spectrometer in (b) has 5000 which is quite more than needed Maybe it is easier to think of the reciprocal $\frac{\Delta m}{m}$ which tells you how far two signal need to be apart so your spectrometer can resolve them In (a) this is $\frac{\Delta m}{m} = \frac{1}{1000} = \frac{1 06}{1060}$ two signals can be resolved if they are at least 1 06 m/z apart at m = 1060 I e if they were slightly further apart than they are The spectrometer in (b) can resolve signals that are at least $\Delta m/z = 0 21$ apart at $m/z = 1060$ FWHM and resolution The FWHM is basically part of the resolution The $\Delta m$ is the m/z difference between two signals that are just resolved Have a look at the IUPAC's definitions of resolution in mass spec There are several approaches to specify what just resolved means The FWHM can be used directly as the $\Delta m$ of the peak width definition If instrument A has $5\times$ the FWHM than instrument B then resolution of A $\approx \frac{1}{5}$ resolution of B I'm more used to the 10 % valley which roughly equals the full with at 5 % height you specify how much signal is allowed at the minimum between the two peaks e g 10 % It is important to realize that these two definitions differ by almost a factor 2 Here are some results of simulated peaks at different resolutions and $\Delta m/z$ (all gaussian which of course doesn't need to be the case in reality) I use the full width at 5% = 10 % valley definitions for the resolution The first row is resolution 5000 with the second row is resolution 1000 You see that the two signals are much better resolved than in your example picture above Which means that above another resolution definition was used possibly $\Delta m$ = FWHM In any case a resolution of 1000 should be almost sufficient to resolve m/z 1060 2 from 1061 2 The third row shows two signals of equal height with $\Delta m/z $ = 1 = FWHM According to the resolution definitions above this is a resolution of ca 520 Note that while you can say that there are at least two peaks you cannot take the two maxima as the m/z of the two underlying signals (grey) The fourth row is almost the same but I multiplied the second signal by 56% to account for the frequency of having bradykinin with one $^{13}$C Looks quite similar to your picture Also have a look at M P Balogh Debating Resolution and Mass Accuracy LC•GC Europe 17(3) 152–159 (2004)
4336,chemistry,When people say that Kohn-Sham orbitals bear no physical meaning they mean it in the sense that nobody has proved mathematically that they mean anything However it has been empirically observed that many times Kohn-Sham orbitals often do look very much like Hartree-Fock orbitals which do have accepted physical interpretations in molecular orbital theory In fact the reference in the OP lends evidence to precisely this latter viewpoint To say that orbitals are good or bad is not really that meaningful in the first place A basic fact that can be found in any electronic structure textbook is that in theories that use determinantal wavefunctions such as Hartree-Fock theory or Kohn-Sham DFT the occupied orbitals form an invariant subspace in that any (unitary) rotation can be applied to the collection of occupied orbitals while leaving the overall density matrix unchanged Since any observable you would care to construct is a functional of the density matrix in SCF theories this means that individuals orbitals themselves aren't physical observables and therefore interpretations of any orbitals should always be undertaken with caution Even the premise of this question is not quite true The energies of Kohn-Sham orbitals are known to correspond to ionization energies and electron affinities of the true electronic system due to Janak's theorem which is the DFT analogue of Koopmans' theorem It would be exceedingly strange if the eigenvalues were meaningful while their corresponding eigenvectors were completely meaningless
4319,chemistry,You will find the answer in probably any textbook on chemical thermodynamics or in a thermochemistry chapter in most physical chemistry textbooks or in Wikipedia's enthalpy of dissolution page Dissolution can be viewed as occurring in three steps Breaking solute-solute attractions (endothermic) see for instance lattice energy in salts Breaking solvent-solvent attractions (endothermic) for instance that of hydrogen bonding Forming solvent-solute attractions (exothermic) in solvation The value of the enthalpy of solution is the sum of these individual steps Dissolving ammonium nitrate in water is endothermic The energy released by solvation of the ammonium ions and nitrate ions is less that the energy absorbed in breaking up the ammonium nitrate ionic lattice and the attractions between water molecules Dissolving potassium hydroxide is exothermic as more energy is released during solvation than is used in breaking up the solute and solvent So it can have any sign The linked page also gives data for common compounds in water some of them endothermic some of them exothermic Regarding why the substance is soluble why its dissolution is endothermic you have to remember that the reaction takes place if $\Delta_r G$ is favourable (i e negative) and $\Delta_r G = \Delta_r H - T \Delta_r S$ Overall the free energy must be negative for dissolution to occur (on a thermodynamic basis; kinetics are another issue) not the enthalpy
4325,chemistry,I'm not familiar with the computational packages -- I'm an experimentalist not a theoretician As an example for why both might be present we can turn to gaseous infrared spectroscopy one will quickly find that the line-widths in vibration-rotation spectra depend on pressure At lower pressures say less than a torr Doppler-broadening is the main mechanism This is Gaussian in nature While at higher pressures the broadening is instead due to collisions which are Lorentzian You'll find combinations of the two and so forth depending on the specifics of your case
4327,chemistry,You can detect $O_{h}$ $I_{h}$ and $T_{d}$ symmetry by checking that a molecule has all of the subgroup symmetries of these point groups According to this untitled document which I presume 1 is by W C Trogler the elements are as follows $T_{d}$ $E$ $4C_{3}$ $3C_{2}$ $3S_{4}$ $6\sigma{_d}$ $O_{h}$ $E$ $3C_4$ $4C_3$ $6C_2$ $4S_6$ $3S_4$ $i$ $3\sigma{_h}$ $6\sigma{_d}$ $I_{h}$ $E$ $6C_{5}$ $10C_{3}$ $15C_{2}$ $i$ $6S_{10}$ $10S_6$ $15\sigma$ Obviously you don't need to check for the identity symmetry $E$ If you're a visual sort of person a symmetry spot check is to mentally superimpose a tetrahedron cube or dodecahedron over the molecule and see whether the view down the surface normal of each face is identical Cubes and octahedra are duals of each other as are dodecahedra and icosahedra The tetrahedron is self-dual Interestingly H&amp;S does not list chiral forms of these point groups probably because they are so rarely encountered however researchers have come up with molecules that obligately satisfy $T$ $I$ and $O$ symmetry 2 (I have not yet read the paper) (1) I would be indebted to anyone who can furnish me with a full citation to this work and confirm the authorship (2) Narasimhan S K Lu X and Luk Y -Y (2008) Chiral molecules with polyhedral T O or I symmetry Theoretical solution to a difficult problem in stereochemistry Chirality 20 878–884
4331,chemistry,Soda contains $\ce{CO2}$ Over time the gaseous $\ce{CO2}$ comes to the surface The ice cream increases the rate of this $\ce{CO2}$ from the soda causing increased fizzing This increased rate is a result of the solvation of ice cream particles in the liquid The particles serve as nucleation sites for the growth of gas bubbles The bubbles get large quiet fast thus you observe fizzing Edit After a bit of experimentation i found the following- Effect of adding milk - There is a bit of extra bubbling and forms a curdy precipitate(couldnt dare to drink it ) Effect of adding salt ( yes ice cream does contain salt ) - Lots of bubbling around the salt After the salt settles to the bottom bubbles collect around it become big and then come to the surface (only thing left to try is sugar and vanilla essence but i ran out of soda) So we come to know that the fizzing effect may be due to milk or salt or a combo of both

4353,chemistry,This answer applies to carbon filtration of water According to most of the sources I found activated carbon binds to most substances through London dispersion forces (from the Wikipedia article) This should mean that it adsorbs larger molecules and non-polar molecules preferentially since they would have larger dispersion forces As your quote indicates it does not bind polar molecules like alcohols glycols strong acids and bases well This source also lists neutral non-polar compounds along with organics and compounds with low water solubility as being effectively removed I think that you may have misread or misinterpreted the sentence about binding chlorine and iodine as saying that it traps chloride iodide and (by extension) other anions well I can't find data to support this statement It traps molecular iodine well and as a large (in terms of electrons) non-polar molecule that makes sense But it removes molecular chlorine $\ce{Cl2}$ through a chemical reaction by reducing it to the chloride ion $\ce{Cl-}$ which is then soluble in water and flows through the filter I did find a couple of sources ( 1 2 ) that said activated charcoal has a slight electropositive charge that helps it to attract negatively charged species which would fit with your statement that it preferentially attracts anions (However they don't list what kind of negative species they're talking about and nitrate sulfate and fluoride ions were specifically excluded) The idea that it will remove ionic compounds seems to be contradicted by the statement in at least a couple of sources ( one given here ) that carbon filters don't remove minerals salts and dissolved inorganic compounds
4350,chemistry,It's been known since 1941 that the answer to your question is in the negative i e that there will never be a closed form equation of state for a nonideal gas In 1941 Mayer and Montroll developed what is now known as the cluster expansion for the partition function of a nonideal gas whose particles have pairwise interactions This cluster expansion provides a 1-1 correspondence between various integrals over the interaction potential and virial coefficients in the Kamerlingh Ohnes equation of state which has in principle an infinite number of terms in it Therefore it would not be considered a closed form equation of state In practice the virial coefficients are known to decay so it is usually safe to truncate the expansion for practical calculations One could extend the cluster expansion to three-body and higher-order interaction potentials but this will not change the fundamental argument above
4345,chemistry,Those are $sp^2$ carbons and should have a triangular planar 120&deg; geometry The angles you've drawn are clearly not 120&deg; I've not exactly come across the terminology before but I believe this is the distinctions In a linear formula you disregard the actual bond angles and just try to keep everything in a line In an angular formula you draw everything according to the bond angles Not sure of this though
4364,chemistry,Basic dishwashing agents Some dishwashing agents contain substantial amounts of NaOH see below Sometimes NaClO solutions are used as disinfectant for dishwashing $\require{mhchem}$ As $\ce{Cl- + ClO- + 2 H+ &lt;=&gt;&gt; Cl2 ^ + H2O}$ they are kept basic (and $\ce{Cl-}$free but $\ce{3 ClO- -&gt; 2 Cl- + ClO3-}$ and $\ce{2 ClO^- -> 2 Cl^- + O2 ^}$) for stabilization @Ashu asked whether I'm really sure so here's an example with 15 - 30 % KOH + 15 - 30 % NaOCl pH 14 Liquid intensive cleaner for dishwashing machines ( technical data saftety sheet both German though) Soaps (chemical meaning) are salts of fatty acids Na- and K-soaps are good for cleaning and as salts of weak acids and strong bases they are basic Dishwashing liquid chemistry If we approximate the food rests you want to clean away during the dishwashing as mixture of carbohydrate proteins and lipids then your dishwashing liquid needs that take care of those 3 substance classes in water carbohydrates are hydrophilic - no problem here amphiphils are needed to clean lipophilic substances like lipids oils greases as Ashu explained already They can take care of quite a bit of protein as well basic solutions usually cause a faster hydrolysis of the amide bonds in proteins than acids Usually quite a bit faster NaOH-solutions immediately give a soapy feeling while e g HCl doesn't As far as I know here (Germany) basic liquids for household dishwashing machines are uncommon/seldom/not used at all (I'm not so sure about the tablets) The actually used solutions are less corrosive (for both the machine and your fingers if you more or less accidentally decide to use it for dishwashing by hand) This page from a New Zealand poison centre talks about the dishwasher [ ] powder or tablets [ ] are often highly alkaline For dishwashing liquids where you are thought/supposed to put your hands in the pH is usually neutral to slightly acidic so you need to scrub a bit more but don't dissolve your skin Acids for cleaning Acids (usually acetic acid or citric acid maybe HCl) are used in household chemistry to clean limescale (CaCO$_3$) But that usually isn't the problem of your dirty dishes Dishwashing machines use ion exchangers to soften the water (or phosphate in the dishwashing agent) so you don't get limescale or lime soaps inside the machine
4368,chemistry,I have to stretch my memory to remember how this goes (and read a bit from here ) First how do you define burgers vector You take the end point of the dislocation and make a circle around it as it were a perfect lattice the extra (or missing step) from the full loop is the burgers vector Now is the burgers vector also a lattice vector If yes then it is (edge)dislocation If no then it is only a partial (edge)dislocation (partial dislocations have their own name) Now how does this work on a fcc-lattice case On quick read for link I pasted it seems that fcc-lattice cannot have edge dislocations because the burgers vector is not a lattice vector You may want to go this through by yourself and check that I didn't make any mistakes
4360,chemistry,Hammett wanted to find a way to quantify the effects electron-withdrawing (EWG) and - donating (EDG) groups have on the transition state or intermediate during the course of a reaction Initially he took the $pK_{\mathrm{a}}$-values of benzoic acids carrying the respective functional group in para or meta position (ortho acids and aliphatic acids weren't used because steric effects would overlay with the electronic effects) as a guide and plotted them against the logarithm of the reaction rates So he based his scale on the following reaction reaction Later Hammett decided not to use the $pK_{\mathrm{a}}$s themselves for his correlation but defined a new parameter which he called $\sigma$ This $\sigma$ shows how electron-donating or -withdrawing a group is relative to $\ce{H}$ as a ratio of the $\log K_a$s or the difference of the $pK_{\mathrm{a}}$ between the substituted benzoate and benzoic acid itself If the acid required to determine $\sigma$ for a new substituent was not available $\sigma$ could be determined by correlation with other reactions A different value of $\sigma$ for any given substituent was needed for the meta and para positions (sometimes called $\sigma_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathrm{p}}$ respectively) The equation for $\sigma$ is \begin{equation} \sigma_{\ce{X}} = \log \left( \frac{ K_{\mathrm{a}}(\ce{X-C6H4COOH}) }{ K_{\mathrm{a}}(\ce{H-C6H4COOH}) } \right) = pK_{\mathrm{a}}(\ce{X-C6H4COOH}) - pK_{\mathrm{a}}(\ce{H-C6H4COOH}) \end{equation} or in short notation \begin{equation} \sigma_{\ce{X}} = \log \left( \frac{ K_{a} (\ce{X}) }{ K_{a} (\ce{H}) } \right) = pK_{\mathrm{a}}(\ce{X}) - pK_{\mathrm{a}}(\ce{H}) \end{equation} where $\ce{X}$ is the functional group i e the EWG or EDG whose effect on the reaction rate shall be evaluated It is also possible to determine the $\sigma$ values via the logarithm of the ratio of the rate constants for the aforementioned reaction with substituent $\ce{X}$ (in short notation $k_{\ce{X}}$) and with $\ce{X}=\ce{H}$ (in short notation $k_{\ce{H}}$) \begin{equation} \sigma_{\ce{X}} = \log \left( \frac{ k_{\ce{X}} }{ k_{\ce{H}} } \right) \end{equation} Update AcidFlask 's comment reminded me that I forgot to say something about $\sigma^{+}$ and $\sigma^{-}$ values As mentioned above the normal $\sigma$ values are based upon the difference of the $pK_{\mathrm{a}}$ between a substituted benzoate and benzoic acid itself But for benzoates one cannot draw resonance structures that delocalize the negative charge onto the benzene ring via the $\pi$ electron system Yet many reations of interest create negative or positive charges that can be stabilized by delocalization via resonance with the substituent For these reactions one finds that Hammett plots using $\sigma$ values have considerable scatter Therefore two new substituent effect scales were produced one for groups that stabilize negative charges via resonance ($\sigma^{-}$) and one for groups that stabilized positive charges via resonance ($\sigma^{+}$) The $\sigma^{-}$ scale is based upon the ionization of para-substituted phenols (I've found different accounts for this According to the German Wikipedia the $\sigma^{-}$ scale is based upon the ionization of para-substituted anilins ) for which groups like nitro can stabilize the negative charge via resonance The $\sigma^{+}$ scale is based upon the heterolysis ($\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}}1$) reaction of para-substituted cumyl chlorides (phenyldimethyl chloromethanes)
4365,chemistry,How flattering that someone asked this question ;) The short answer is yes I've tried QTPIE on series of conjugated molecules like the oligoacetylenes and oligoacenes The results however are fairly dismal as can be seen in the preprint The problem is that in these empirical charge models the polarizability grows faster than the size of the molecule which means that these models predict infinite polarizabilities and charge transport behavior for bulk materials which is obviously nonsense The problem is quite intimately related to that of self-interaction error in approximate density functional theories which also exhibit similar problems
18076,chemistry,You can functionalize silica to add polymer brushes to the surface You can also buy pre-made functionalized silica although the downside to that is it isn't always easy to get the manufacturer to tell you exactly what is on the surface This isn't really going to increase the attractive interactions between the silica and the polystyrene however Polystyrene has a bulky aromatic ring hanging off of each monomer and no sites that can participate in hydrogen bonding When you add hydrophobic brushes to the surface of the silica what you are doing is limiting the ability of the silica to aggregate due to hydrophilic interactions with itself As a result given enough kinetic energy (temperature for melt casting or sonication for solvent casting) you can get the particles to disperse Then if you solidify the polymer quickly enough they will be kinetically trapped in a dispersed state Depending on what your goal is this could be enough for your application However if you want to get the particles to strongly attract to the polystyrene you aren't going to be able to get much farther than van der Waals interactions That's a limitation of the polystyrene not the silica Other particles (gold or carbon nanotubes for example) will be more hydrophobic and easier to disperse without functionalizing but you still are not going to get very strong attractive forces between the particles and the polymer
8371,chemistry,Some density functional theory packages such as Quantum Espresso can calculate XPS core level shifts using the pseudopotential formalism See Phys Rev B 74 045430 (2006)
4373,chemistry,We don't have a homework policy yet but I'm quite sure that it will be against providing full answers Hints You're supposed to take into account molar masses The ratios in a formula are molar ratios so you need to use those not mass ratios Read up a bit on emperical formulae as Janice suggested
16389,chemistry,According Kinetics Mechanism and Spectroscopy of the Reversible Binding of Nitric Oxide to Aquated Iron(II) An Undergraduate Text Book Reaction Revisited The correct structure is $\ce{ [Fe^{III}(H_2O)_5(NO^{-})]^{2+} }$ For many years it was thought that iron was reduced to Fe(I) and NO oxidized to NO+ based upon an observed magnetic moment suggestive of three unpaired electrons however the current thinking is that high spin Fe(III) (S=5/2) antiferromagnetically couples with NO- (S=1) for an observed spin of S=3/2
4391,chemistry,Alas the problem of course is that you need both position q and momentum p to get an accurate picture of the overall electron state This is not true in quantum mechanics; it is sufficient to characterize the wavefunction $\left\langle x |\psi\right\rangle$ in position space or $\left\langle k|\psi\right\rangle$ in momentum space Which is chosen is entirely a matter of convenience most molecules have the most compact description in position space while most crystals have compact descriptions in momentum space It can be proven that position alone or momentum alone form a complete basis separately In fact position-momentum uncertainly says that an electron state cannot be characterized completely in both position and momentum simultaneously (This by the way has nothing to do with fermionic symmetries and Pauli exclusion which is another quantum-mechanical axiom unto itself The same would have held for looking at bosonic particles also ) It is however true that a probability density in phase space $(q p)$ is needed to completely characterize a classical system Wigner's function was introduced to address this quantum-classical correspondence and is regarded as the quantum analogue of a classical probability distribution in phase space However it is also well known that it can take on negative values and therefore cannot be interpreted in the usual way as a probability distribution This affects all methods using the Wigner function in the Springborg paper in the OP there are regions of negative probability density in the lithium hydride molecule being analyzed Suffice to say the question of how to deal with negative probabilities is an extremely controversial subject Having said that the Wigner function has found uses in ab initio molecular dynamics when a classical phase space density is required to sample dynamical trajectories from the potential energy surface generated by quantum electronic states The regions of negative probability are usually neglected in such procedures with seemingly no loss of accuracy (to my knowledge) I am not aware of other common usages in electronic structure theory (The other problem brought up in the OP about the inaccuracies in DFT are conventionally attributed to incorrect modeling of electron correlation effects which is a matter of incorrect treatments of fermion symmetries and its consequences when projected down into coordinate or momentum space )
4381,chemistry,FWIW here are some Hückel calculations on the 5775 PAH I'm showing the first 7 energy levels Each molecular graph presents the contribution of each atom to the electron density ($\mathrm{Abs}[c_i]^2$) This is not normalized I do not use wavefunctions only the coefficients multiplying them assuming $$\Psi_{\mathrm{mol}} = \sum_i^n c_i\psi_i$$ In this approximation (HMO) the first 7 energy levels will be occupied (14 pi electrons) I will first give you pictures of each energy level and then a linear combination of each Take it for what it is as there is much information lost in the process To me this simply suggests that indeed the system will behave as if composed of tropylium and cyclopentadienyl ions But this is not publication quality calculation either =) Here are compared the linear combination of the first 7 energy levels of the 5775 and 6666 systems It is clear that electron distribution is not the same in both PAHs which hints that my calculations are not so far fetched 5775 6666
4382,chemistry,I would be surprised if there was reticulation of the gum's polymers upon contact with your saliva According to this manufacturer plasticizers are used and the plasticizers appear to be fats This would mean that upon chewing the plasticizers would be removed from the gum rendering it unpleasantly harder Plasticizers are used to render a polymer more pliable more elastic than it naturally is This could get its own question imo
4387,chemistry,Le Châtelier's principle only states that a system previously at equilibrium will want to stay at equilibrium - that is if we perturb it it will try to go back to equilibrium This system is initially not at equilibrium and therefore we don't need his principle I think the reaction proceeds because the formation of AgCl (s) is enthalpically favored Molecular cohesion (enthalpy) is greater in AgCl than in AgNO 3 thus promoting its formation How do I know that Well it seems AgCl is less ionic than AgNO 3 since it is insoluble in water This reaction is a type of metathesis reaction It can be called double displacement reaction or salt metathesis reaction depending on who you're talking with EDIT The other answers make an error I think Both suggest that the solubility product of AgCl is of importance in determining why the reaction takes place My opinion is that the argument as presented is circular in the following manner The solubility product of AgCl in water is very low therefore we observe formation of a precipitate vs AgCl is insoluble in water therefore its solubility product is low It's easy to see that the fact AgCl is insoluble in water implies that it has a low K sp in water If someone can predict and quantify the solubility product of AgCl in water from first principles then that's another story but the explanations offered only rely on observation (experiment) to quantify the K sp My argument goes down the ladder If you can answer why AgCl is insoluble in water then you can definitely predict that Ag + and Cl - ions from different sources (i e in different solutions) put into contact will spontaneously form a precipitate Now you maybe thinking this argument is also circular but it's not We have access to experiment which clearly informs us that AgCl is insoluble in water We can confidently assume (but we might be wrong ) that the AgCl bond is less ionic than the AgNO 3 bond since it practically does not dissociate/has a low K sp in water A bond with a greater covalent character is more stable since the electrons are shared and not transfered Perhaps the crystal structure of AgCl makes it especially stable to solubilization from H 2 O I just think it's obvious that the enthalpy of formation of AgCl is favorable since it has to counter an unfavorable entropy loss in the formation of an ordered crystal lattice As you can see I cannot provide you with a thorough answer it would be extremely time consuming (for me) and I'd have to conduct many many calculations I really hope someone can clarify the why Maybe you can do your own research from the answers provided here and come back with a more elaborate answer
4386,chemistry,The salt's crystal lattice's repeating unit is constituted of n molecules of salt and m molecules of water Such salts are called hydrates Wikipedia even has a nice picture of a hydrated vs non hydrated salt You can have anhydrous ferrous chloride as well as ferrous chloride tetrahydrate The number indicates how many water molecules are present in the crystal lattice's unit cell EDIT This has just crossed my mind be careful when preparing solutions of metal complexes to make sure you know what compound you're working with One gram of anhydrous salt contains more equivalents than a gram of hydrated salt This information should be obvious on the bottle If not ask a lab tech if they can identify the hydrated/anhydrous salt by memory
4628,chemistry,One of way to answer this question is to put it in some QM software The system is small enough and has higher symmetry so computations shouldn't take to long even on an older computer For co-planar geometry the energy calculated at B3LYP/6-31G(d p) is –492 132206748 a u The geometry with dihedral angle of 90° between $\ce{CO2}$ and $\ce{C3N2}$ is –492 116719625 a u That makes roughly 41 kJ/mol (10 kcal/mol) Now if you really want to be sure if that's the right energy you should make frequency calculations on both structures to find out if they are minima or transition states This can take a bit longer (I haven't done it) and I would expect that the better structure (with lower energy) should have no imaginary frequencies and the higher one should have one (TS) If by some accident both of them are minima than TS has probably a dihedral angel somewhere around 45° Of course this is only computation It gives as clues but not the exact answer You can go for higher level of theory add solvent modelling and or you can take your compound and try to make temperature depending NMR spectra With a bit of luck you can freeze your TS and find out how high is your barrier p s It would be good if you mention in your post what tools (in this case computational) are available to you I really would prefer to explain how to get the number instead of giving just dry answer
4396,chemistry,Other answers have emphasized the fact that oxygen is not a fuel but an oxidizing agent I'll try to underline another point there is no uniquely defined “combustion temperature” for a chemical compound This is unlike phase transitions like melting and ebullition which happen at fixed temperature for a given pressure The temperature of a combustion process depends on many parameters including the heat of combustion the ratio of air to fuel the heat capacity of both and the initial temperature The adiabatic flame temperature is one of such combustion temperatures under certain conditions The autoignition temperature and flash point on the other hand are characteristics of a given chemical compound; they are not however combustion temperatures
4406,chemistry,strong Bases in general are not suitable as they will react with $\ce{CO2}$ from the air This is actually more problematic than hygroscopicity as it means that you also cannot store diluted NaOH solution (openly) as standard Instead $\ce{Na2CO3}$ or $\ce{KHCO3}$ are much better alternatives (for strong acids) The acids are either a gas (HCl) or are produced from gas I don't see how you can produce a conentration reliably enough for use as primary standard even if you would manage to produce saturated HCl it's much more difficult and less reliable than known alternatives (see below) but that wouldn't work e g for $\ce{H2SO4}$ as $\ce{SO3}$ is soluble in $\ce{H2SO4}$ (Oleum) $\ce{HNO3}$ redox reactions are not only not particularly useful but actually harmful as they use up acid equivalents $\ce{NO3- + 2e- + \mathbf{2 H+} -&gt; NO2- + H2O}$ also here a solid alternative (KH-Phthalate) is available If you don't have that you may get away with oxalic acid which is still better than the acids suggested here
4398,chemistry,My understanding is that turbidity is an adjective describing the presence or degree of particulate matter suspended in a liquid (see turbidimetry ) whereas a precipitate is a particulate that can result in turbidity The turbidity generated by a precipitate is a function of its ability to form a stable suspension If the precipitate simply drops to the bottom of a container or readily flocculates the resultant turbidity will be low The turbidity of a suspension is also going to be a function of the solvent and the nature and concentration of dissolved ions - a dramatic example of this is the rapid clarification of muddy freshwater at river deltas mixing with salt water If the word turbidity is being used as a noun it is probably referring to a light-occluding suspension
4428,chemistry,I'll have a stab at this one despite the fact I've forgotten almost the totality of engineering thermodynamics as I do recall seeing these papers before One of the references 1 in the Wikipedia article describes the production of slush hydrogen through the auger technique contrasting it with the freeze-thaw method Specifically the auger method can be performed above the triple point pressure of hydrogen whereas the freeze-thaw method uses the latent heat of vaporisation to freeze some of the hydrogen In this technique the vaporisation of some of the hydrogen (prompted by the application of a vacuum) at the triple point causes some of the liquid hydrogen to freeze generating a crust of solid hydrogen which is then broken up to make slush As far as I can tell the triple point conditions are only required to make the freeze-thaw process go and are not required for storage The auger technique also described in the report 1 seems to work on the basis of shaving solid hydrogen which is refrigerated with liquid helium Voth compares the technique to a conventional ice shaver (albeit much much colder ) In this instance there's no requirement for triple point conditions which is given as one of the advantages of the technique Finally Haberbusch and McNelis 2 give us this sad quote in reference to a 1991 paper According to Hans projected annual demand for slush hydrogen in the year 2010 is 584 million pounds to support a fleet of 20 spaceplanes One day maybe (1) Voth R O ; Producing Liquid-Solid Mixtures of Hydrogen in an Auger ; National Bureau of Standards Department of Commerce; 1978 pp 1-16 (2) Haberbusch M S and McNelis N B ; Comparison of the Continuous Freeze Slush Hydrogen Production Technique to the Freeze-Thaw Technique ; NASA Technical Memorandum 107324 1996 p 1
4403,chemistry,As you noted the solvent-accessible surface area is a geometric concept and as such is most easily calculated using computational geometry tools from a given molecular (or crystalline) structure However you obtain this atomistic structure (X-ray neutrons molecular simulation NMR …) is of course of significant importance to the resulting area but the calculation method will be the same There are however a few studies which have attempted to link the solvent-accessible surface area to directly measurable properties and in particular to spectroscopic properties A quick search of the literature reveals three examples Amide H/ 2 H Exchange MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry UV Raman directly on the exposed residues Using diazirine as a probe
4414,chemistry,The MSMS part is the detection of the LC in this case (nb you don't need to do LC-MSMS you can do direct infusion quite happily if you don't need to separate anything) so the actual experiment wouldn't need to take much longer than any other LC (as CHM says) However calibration + set-up of these things and extensive cleaning afterwards can make it a day's job to run just a few samples (even direct infusion) If you don't have much information on the system already you may also find that you need to do a 'sighting' run to work out which ions you need to examine more closely (MSMS) And then there is data processing All in all quick if you know exactly what you want and someone is running everything for you If you want to argue that it is an easy job you can but be aware that this is not always gong to be the case
4439,chemistry,I don't have a full answer but a hint at how to choose your liquid You want the ferrofluid not to mix with it so your fluid has to be immiscible with the ferrofluid solvent (or carrier fluid; ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions) In the case of your “FerroFluid EFH-1” the solvent is a light mineral oil so you should go with a polar solvent Secondly you want the ferrofluid solvent not to touch the glass to avoid staining In order to do so you need your liquid to wet the bottle more than the mineral oil i e to have a smaller contact angle You can play on both the bottle material and nature of the fluid to achieve this I suggest protic polar solvents which should wet regular glass well water ethanol isopropanol acetic acid …
4427,chemistry,In the comment to my previous answer you asked for a theoretical reason for the solubilities not considering energy data Since I know from energy considerations that the issue is not the solvation of the anions I can present a reason based on the strength of the ionic bond in the two compounds This reference (as well as others) states the the boning in $\ce{AgCl}$ has unusually high covalent character which makes it a tighter bond The $\ce{Ag+}$ ion and the $\ce{Cl-}$ ion are close to the same size (with the silver ion being smaller) so they can approach each other quite closely In silver nitrate the $\ce{NO3-}$ ion is larger and does not allow as close an approach as the chloride ion so the bond is weaker easier to break up and the salt is more soluble
4413,chemistry,Magnetite has a spinel structure with two types of $\ce{Fe}$ sites octahedral and tetrahedral respectively in green and orange below (in this structure oxygen atoms are the small red balls) This structure is called a spinel with $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ ion in tetrahedral coordination and $\ce{Fe^{3+}}$> ions in octahedral sites The coupling between atoms from these two lattices are superexchange interactions which result in an antiparallel alignment of spins However because the magnetic moments of the two lattices are not equal their addition results in a net magnetic moment even though they are of opposition alignment This is called ferrimagnetism and in practice most of its macroscopic properties are similar to ferromagnetism though they stem from a completely different microscopic magnetic ordering
4419,chemistry,Conventional soaps are the sodium salts of long chain carboxylic acids (aka fatty acids) These are formed by the hydrolysis of triglycerides a process known as saponification This process breaks the triglyceride at its ester linkages and yields three fatty acid molecules and glycerol molecule As the aforementioned wikipedia article indicates sodium lauryl sulfate is formed by refunctionalising the fatty acid lauric acid In this case the $\ce{R-OOH}$ (carboxylic acid) head group has been replaced with an $\ce{R-OH}$ (alcohol) group which is in turn replaced by $\ce{R-OSO3^{-}}$ (sulfate) Here I am using $\ce{R}$ to refer to the long alkyl chain of the molecule I'm not sure whether sodium lauryl sufate occurs naturally however the other molecules you mention are different in the sense that they have carboxylate ($\ce{R-COO^{-}}$) head groups whereas sodium lauryl sulfate has the sulfate head group ($\ce{R-OSO3^{-}}$) Both classes of molecule will act as surfactants as they have polar head groups which are hydrophilic and nonpolar alkyl tails which have an affinity for fats and oils Lauric acid derivatives spotter's guide (These were drawn using the nifty ChemFig package for (La)TeX ) The last two (sodium laurate and sodium lauryl sulfate) are sodium salts Both carboxylic acids ($\ce{R-COOH}$) and hydrogen alkyl sulfates ($\ce{R-OSO3H}$) are fairly willing to ionise to give the corresponding carboxylate ($\ce{R-COO^{-}}$) or sulfate ($\ce{R-OSO3^{-}}$) Sodium ions happily associate with these anions balancing the negative charge
4495,chemistry,The reactivity of NHS activated esters has mostly been desribed quite anecdotically They are susceptible to hydrolysis in water the kinetics of which is dependent on the nature of the NHS activated group (ester vs carnonate vs carbamate) as well as on the pH of the reaction buffer 1 which is one way to show that primary amines are not the only nucleophile which can react with NHS-activated esters As for the chemical groups that have been observed to react with NHS activated esters I did find a couple of examples upon looking up this issue For instance the Zenobi group have attempted a quite systematic study on the groups that can react with doubly NHS activated cross-linkers Citing the abstract 2 As soon as additional cross-linkers were attached or loops were formed other amino acids were also involved in the reaction In addition to the primary amino groups serine threonine and tyrosine showed significant reactivity due to the effect of neighboring amino acids by intermediate or permanent Type-1 cross-link formation The reactivity is highly dependent on the pH and on adjacent amino acids In an earlier work the reactivity of a biotinylation NHS-ester based reagent was assessed on a single peptide [D-Lys(6)]gonadotropin releasing hormone A similar reactivity of -OH groups was observed with in addition that of the arginine guanidinium group 3 In addition to the O-acylation of Ser(4) and Tyr(5) in this peptide we have also identified a novel biotinylation of the Arg(8) side chain Other groups have also observed some reactivity with cysteins (sulfhydryl groups) but in a situation where the reagent is included within a ligand of the target protein One can assume as do the authors that specific positionning of the ligand within the binding site can lead to binding with a cystein group 4 5 From these earlier work one cas conclude in answer to your question that although primary amines are the most reactive group for NHS-ester derivatization other groups present in peptide side-chains (-OH for tyrosine serine threonine guanidinium for arginine and sulfhydryls for cysteins) The last issue raised in the question remains that of the secondary amine groups It is widely accepted that pH influences strongly the kinetics of NHS derivatization mostly through protonation of the amine groups which cannot act as nucleophiles in protonated state This has been put to use in controlling the buffer pH in order to favor N-terminal reaction vs lysine side chain reaction Although in my experience it is not at all a straightforward experiment and it is highly dependent on the nature of the derivatization group One could hypothesize that since secondary amines are more basic then primary amines the reactivity of secondary amines towards NHS should be reduced compared to primary amines but I have no experimental or litterature proof for this part of the answer
4622,chemistry,Amines left out in the atmosphere will air-oxidize to give N-oxides which typically have a yellow color These N-oxides can decompose to give further byproducts I would store your sparteine under nitrogen or argon atmosphere [edit to give examples and mechanism] The reaction proceeds through a radical chain mechanism with molecular oxygen Here is one study of the mechanism [from first page of Google search for amines air-oxidation] From wikipedia article for triethylenetetramine This oily liquid is colourless but like many amines assumes a yellowish color due to impurities resulting from air-oxidation It can be observed that arylamines develop a yellow or black color if left exposed to air for prolonged periods Ref Note - I realize that sparteine is not an aromatic amine but the result is the same If you have access to triethylamine or other amines in your lab do a control experiment leave one vial open to air and leave the other under identical conditions except sealed under an inert atmosphere A few days worth of observation will convince you of the role in oxygen in the yellowing of amines
4433,chemistry,The character of the bond is determined by the electronegativity of the atoms Speaking of bonds as purely ionic or covalent is not always correct - usually it is more correct to say that a bond has ionic or covalent characteristics So comparing the difference in electronegativities gives us the following 0 0 - 0 4 non-polar covalent 0 4 - 1 7 polar covalent &gt; 1 7 ionic At the upper end of the polar covalent spectrum the bonds frequently have both covalent and ionic characteristics For organometallic compounds the difference in electronegativity between Li and C is 1 57 So while this is still in the polar covalent range it is also close to ionic Similarly the difference between Mg and C is 1 24 - again a very polar covalent bond Compare this to the difference between H and C => 0 35 - a non-polar covalent bond So to answer your question the thing that is special about carbon is that it has a fairly low electronegativity compared to the Oxygen and Fluorine Group atoms Granted bonds with carbon are also going to be weaker than in say LiCl but that's what makes organometallic compounds actually work to form carbon-carbon bonds (The electronegativity values came from wikipedia's great chart )
4449,chemistry,It does appear that the graphene sheets fold back on themselves This paper reports that the graphene sheets that make up both natural and synthetic graphite double back over each other with nano-arches This is an from the paper There are also SEM and TEM micrographs of a graphite crystal that are pretty interesting
4432,chemistry,First a note while oxygen has fewer allotropes than sulfur it sure has more than two These include O O 2 1 O 2 O 3 O 4 O 8 metallic O and four other solid phases Many of these actually have a corresponding sulfur variant However you are right in a sense that sulfur has more tendency to catenate… let's try to see why Here are the values of the single and double bond enthalpies ( source ) O—O 142 kJ/mol S–S 268 kJ/mol O=O 499 kJ/mol S=S 352 kJ/mol This means that O=O is stronger than S=S while O–O is weaker than S–S So in sulfur single bonds are favoured and catenation is easier than in oxygen compounds It seems that the reason for the weaker S=S double bonds has its roots in the size of the atom it's harder for the two atoms to come at a small enough distance so that the $p$ orbitals overlap is small and the $\pi$ bond is weak This is attested by looking down the periodic table Se=Se has an even weaker bond enthalpy of 272 kJ/mol ( source )
4437,chemistry,Yes Papers in the field of preparation or selection of nuclear spin isomers have introductions that justify the work by potential applications and some of them include chemical reactions either under that name or under the more descriptive terminology of “reactive collisions” While no specific cases are cited as examples the potential exist but only in limited situations such as bimolecular reaction in molecular beams From what I have seen the canonical reference is “Detailed symmetry selection rules for reactive collisions” Mol Phys 1977 34 477–504 This is the theoretical paper laying out the foundations of the effect of nuclear spin isomerism on reactions I don't have access to the full text but here is the abstract                     It confirms what I suggested in my earlier comment the different nuclear spin isomers have different rovibrational states and accounting for effect changes the selection rules indicating which collisions are reactive or not One specific example which I found is “Observation of Ortho-Para H3+ Selection Rules in Plasma Chemistry” Phys Rev Lett 1997 78 3844–3847 Large dependences of the intensity ratios on the parent gases have been observed indicating the spin memory of protons even after chemical reactions The results clearly demonstrate the existence of selection rules on nuclear spin modifications in chemical reactions theoretically anticipated by M Quack Their results are obtained on the formation of H 3 + ions from a H 2 plasma
4448,chemistry,I liked this question because I had never thought much about it However it's not such a mistery because the answer is in the Wikipedia “radical” page Historically the term radical was also used for bound parts of the molecule especially when they remain unchanged in reactions These are now called functional groups For example methyl alcohol was described as consisting of a methyl radical and a hydroxyl radical Neither are radicals in the modern chemical sense as they are permanently bound to each other and have no unpaired reactive electrons However they can be observed as radicals in mass spectrometry when broken apart by irradiation with energetic electrons So the free in free radical was originally used to distinguish it from a radical bound to a carbon skeleton Digging into historical chemistry texts reveals that “free radical” becomes really widely used around 1930 However some quotes for earlier works use it though it does not appear so frequently that it may be considered a common expression… i e it is at that time simply the juxtaposition of the adjective free with radical which is then synonymous with group (or today's noun substituent ) For example “This hydrocarbon was formerly supposed to be the free radical of the methyl group but no methyl compounds have in any way been derived from it whilst by the action of chlorine upon it ethyl chloride is obtained as the product” (1870 Lessons in elementary chemistry ) or “Although however the free radical methylene is unknown many of its compounds have been prepared of which some such as the haloid ethers &amp;c ” (1884 A Treatise on Chemistry Henry Enfield Roscoe and Carl Schorlemmer) Though more quotes could be dug and provided the ones I've read support this idea that free radical initially meant “the chemical group as a molecule by itself”
4629,chemistry,Inorganic structures – that could be proper solid or molecular metalloorgnic For the later one you can use xp (program written G M Shedrick - comes with Bruker diffractometers) If you have running license of Cambridge Crystal Data Base there is program called IsoStar and I think that it should do the job I haven't used it my self but apparently Olex2 can make aligning of fragments (this program is free so that's the place were you can start) I'm not quite sure but I think that old GROMOS code could also make a fit of orthogonal coordinates
4443,chemistry,but I can't find any canonical reference as to that Look harder ;-) It seems to be that the lone pair has lowest priority OK I can't find any authoritative reference to that (I don't have access to the original paper ) but I've got plenty of others Alright IUPAC says Except for hydrogen ligancy if not already four is made up to four by adding phantom atoms which have atomic number zero (0) and are thus always last in order of preference This has various uses but perhaps the most interesting is where nitrogen occurs in a rigid skeleton as for example in a-isosparteine (14); here the phantom atom can be placed where the nitrogen lone pair of electrons is; then N-i appears as shown alongside the formula and the chiraiity (R) is the consequence; the same applies to N-i6 Phantom atoms are similarly used when assigning chirality symbols to chiral sulfoxides (see example to Rule E—4 9) When ligancy is less than four we obviously have some lone pairs hanging around (except in Hydrogen--which has been excluded and some other cases like carbocations--which are planar anyway) So the lone pair becomes a phantom atom and has 0 priority Now I wonder what happens to these rules if you have two lone pairs one of them muonic ;-) Check the first revision of this post for my original non-authoritative references
4461,chemistry,This answer is intended to supplement Manishearth's earlier answer rather than compete with it My objective is to show how octet rules can be helpful even for molecules that contain more than the usual complement of eight electrons in their valence shell I call it donation notation and it dates back to my high school days when none of the chemistry of the texts in my small-town library bothered to explain how those oxygen bonds worked in anions such as carbonate chlorate sulfate nitrate and phosphate The idea behind this notation is simple You begin with the electron dot notation then add arrows that show whether and how other atoms are borrowing each electron A dot with an arrow means that that the electron belongs mainly to the atom at the base of the arrow but is being used by another atom to help complete that atom's octet A simple arrow without any dot indicates that the electron has effectively left the original atom In that case the electron is no longer attached to the arrow at all but is instead shown as an increase in the number of valence electrons in the atoms at the end of the arrow Here are examples using table salt (ionic) and oxygen (covalent) Notice that the ionic bond of $\ce{NaCl}$ shows up simply as an arrow indication that it has donated its outermost electron and fallen back to its inner octet of electrons to satisfy its own completion priorities (Such inner octets are never shown ) Covalent bonds happen when each atom contributes one electron to a bond Donation notation shows both electrons so doubly bonded oxygen winds up with four arrows between the atoms Donation notation is not really needed for simple covalent bonds however It's intended more for showing how bonding works in anions Two closely related examples are calcium sulfate ($\ce{CaSO4}$ better known as gypsum) and calcium sulfite ($\ce{CaSO3}$ a common food preservative) In these examples the calcium donates via a mostly ionic bond so its contribution becomes a pair of arrows that donate two electrons to the core of the anion completing the octet of the sulfur atom The oxygen atoms then attach to the sulfur and borrow entire electrons pairs without really contributing anything in return This borrowing model is a major factor in why there can be more than one anion for elements such as sulfur (sulphates and sulfites) and nitrogen (nitrates and nitrites) Since the oxygen atoms are not needed for the central atom to establish a full octet it is possible for some of the pairs in the central octet to remain unattached This results in less oxidized anions such as sulfites and nitrites Finally a more ambiguous example is sulfur hexafluoride The figure shows two options Should $\ce{SF6}$ be modeled as if the sulfur is a metal that gives up all of its electrons to the hyper-aggressive fluorine atoms (option a) or as a case where the octet rule gives way to a weaker but still workable 12-electron rule (option b) There is some controversy even today about how such cases should be handled The donation notation shows how an octet perspective can still be applied to such cases though it is never a good idea to rely on first-order approximation models for such extreme cases 2014-04-04 Update Finally if you are tired of dots and arrows and y
4455,chemistry,Yes For some chiral compounds each enantiomer in a racemic mixture absorbs certain frequencies of light differently depending on the circular polarization type of the light That means that if you can pump in sufficiently intense and energetic (e g ultraviolet) circular polarized light pulses into the racemic mix of such compounds you may in some cases increase the rate of breakdown of the enantiomer that absorbs that particular circular polarization (left or right) resulting in an increase in the relative concentration of the other enantiomer You can view the first page of a paper on asymmetric photolysis using circularly polarized ultraviolet light here
4514,chemistry,The reaction coordinate is the progress of a reaction from reactants to products with various intermediates and transition states in between It is an abstraction It has no relation to time Rather it is the progress of bond-forming and bond-breaking reaction steps The free energy change of partially formed and partially broken bonds cannot be measured The free energies of transition states (local maxima) cannot be directly measured These states are transient and cannot be directly observed For a simple reaction with few mechanistic steps the activation energy (transition state energy) can be calculated from kinetics measurements The free energy of intermediates can often be determined directly or indirectly if they are long-lived Most of these diagrams are assembled from a few measured data points and either extrapolation or theoretical computation If two reaction coordinate axes are presented this often means that there are two separate pathways the reaction can take and each pathway is presented on one of the two reaction coordinate axes Perhaps the reaction involves two different steps but those steps need not happen in the same order every time As a generic example consider nucleophilic substitution reactions in organic chemistry A generic nucleophile (Nu - ) reacts with an organic molecule R-X where X is a leaving group and R is the rest of the molecule (which is unchanged or nearly unchanged) The overall reaction would be Nu - + R-X --> Nu-R + X - This process involves two steps forming the bond between Nu and R and breaking the bond between R and X These two steps can happen in three different orders 1) the R-X bond breaks first and the R-Nu bond forms second (this is the dissociative or S N 1 mechanism); 2) The R-Nu bond forms first and the R-X bond breaks second (this is the associative or S N Ac mechanism); and 3) The R-X bond breaks and the R-Nu bond forms at the same time (this is the intermediate or S N 2 mechanism) All three of these cases occur in reactions that are covered in any undergraduate organic chemistry text These three processes would look like the following The items in parentheses are transition states with partially formed/broken bonds (---) Dissociative Step 1 Nu - + R-X --> (Nu - + R---X) --> Nu - + R + + X - Step 2 Nu - + R + + X - --> (Nu---R + X - ) --> Nu-R + X - Associative Step 1 Nu - + R-X --> (Nu---R-X) --> [Nu-R-X] - Step 2 [Nu-R-X] - --> (Nu-R---X) --> Nu-R + X - Intermediate Only step Nu - + R-X --> (Nu---R---X) --> Nu-R + X - A reaction coordinate energy diagram for a substitution process could then be graphed over two different reaction coordinates breaking the R-X bond and forming the R-Nu bond For ease of two dimensional representation these are often presented as contour diagrams Various trajectories could be taken through this space based on what real species R Nu and X represent For example if R+ is a stabilized cation then the dissociative pathway becomes more likely These plots are called More O'Ferrall-Jencks plots This link will take you to the wikipedia article which is not a very good article The references in that article to the papers by R A More O'Ferrall and W P Jencks are probably better places to go to find out more Most advanced undergraduate or graduate level textbooks of physical organic chemistry particularly Advanced Organic Chemistry Part A Structure and Mechanisms by Carey and Sundberg will c
18394,chemistry,Graphite is a semimetal and no more mambojumbo than with metals but it doesn't do anything with the problem Silicon/silica can be melted purified doped can single crystals grown can oxidize the surface making the silicon semiconductor an silica insulator By can I mean that engineeers know well tested methods optimized for half a century Graphite cannot be reasonably melted cannot grown to single crystals cannot doped with similar techniques highly anisotropic so cutting maybe an issue and when you make thin layers it is hard to oxidize in a controlled way to make an insulator out of it The resulted oxides are semiconductors and there is a large variety of local structures that can appear with different electronic properties By cannot I mean that no one really though about these problems until the last decade so there might be equivalent solutions with e g graphene nanotube or other nanocarbon structures
4465,chemistry,The curling up has a simple reason the burning was not uniform Paper contains water (really ) and heating it makes it lose the water Now paper is a bad conductor of heat When you burn it inevitably the flame will be mainly on one side(the side that's pointing up) The flame will transfer heat to nearby regions of paper and evaporate some (or possibly all) of the water The loss of water leads to a contraction of the cellulose fibers in the paper (I'm not too sure of this comments appreciated) But this only happens on one side of the paper Even though paper is razor-thin the fact that it still has two faces is important here Now due to the contraction the paper curls in that direction (similar to how a bimetallic strip works) That's it The reason for retaining texture is something I'm not too sure about The burning reaction throws up a lot of soot but a lot of the products stay right where they are This results in the charred/burnt paper occupying the previous position of the cellulose While charred paper isn't a polymer and thus isn't too strong it can mimic the initial structure just by occupying the position of the cellulose But unlike cellulose if we try bending it it will crumble since there are no long polymer chains /intermolecular forces holding it together It's like the difference between a house of cards and a similar house made of a single piece of rubber The structure is the same but the former case is only staying together because it had the luck to exist in a stable configuration Disturbing it will destroy it
4542,chemistry,Azane all by itself has an inversion barrier of about 6 kcal/mol which is low compared to phosphine's approximately 30 kcal/mol barrier Pyramidal nitrogen inversion requires a planar transition state One can use a classical theory to model the thermal rate and we could write $$k \propto e^{-E_a/RT} $$ and using models like these we would predict that ammonia at 300 K would have a rate on the order of $10^8 s^{-1}$ instead what is observed is something on the order of $10^{10} s^{-1}$ Assuming the potential energy surface has two minima equal in energy and a higher energy TS two routes are possible a thermal process going over the maxima or quantum-mechanical tunneling Determining a tunneling frequency requires writing down vibrational wave functions finding their linear combination and overlap If we were to do all this for a particular vibration we'd see that the tunneling frequency decreases exponentially with a dependence on increasing $\mu$ thickness of the barrier/shape and the barrier height As an example $\ce{ND3}$ has approximately an order of magnitude slower rate of inversion than $\ce{NH3}$ at a sufficiently low temperature -- this has been attributed to a decrease in its tunneling frequency But why the difference in the energy barriers and corresponding rates depending on the atomic position in the periodic table Perhaps the easiest/quickest explanation rests on considering what the TS requires for interconversion Ideally the classical conversion requires passing through a trigonal planar structure with bond angles on the order of 120 degrees If you consider the series of azane phosphane arsane then you'll see bond angles of 108 94 92 degrees respectively In the absence of other effects the barrier goes from smaller to larger Indeed asane-like molecules were the first of this series resolved followed by phosphane-like To the best of my knowledge the fastest have yet to be resolved because rates on the order of $10^{-5} s^{-1}$ are required at RT for a decent shot at isolating them Naturally this isn't the whole story as I've previously alluded to above Let me know if you would like to know more
4627,chemistry,The Pmma is a minimal non-isomorphic supergroup of Pmm2 ; or you can say that Pmm2 is one of maximal non-isomorphic sub-groups of Pmma How to solve the question (1) fast and dirty take International Tables for Crystallography vol A go to your group (in mine edition Pmma starts on p 274) On second page describing space group you can find Maximal non-isomorphic subgroups The third listed is [2] Pmm2 (25) 1; 2; 7; 8 You can see that the operation in #50 and #25 have a lot of similarities No 1 you can ignore as it's [x y z] but 2 7 and 8 for #50 are [-x+ 5 -y z] [x -y z] and [-x+ 5 y z] As one can see the #25 has following general operators (2) [-x -y z] (3) [x -y z] and (4) [-x y z] (2) The hard way Mathematics is explain in the same volume in chapter 13 1 Isomorphic subgroups Of course the knowledge of group theory and matrix calculus is to your advantage ;-)
4469,chemistry,The bag contains a supersaturated solution of some salt with a highly negative enthalpy of crystallisation which could be something like sodium acetate ($\ce{Na^{+}CH3CO2^{-}}$) The dissolved salt would really like to come out of solution but lacks a nucleation site Bending the metal disk produces a transient site where crystallisation can begin and from there are chain reaction results causing all of the solute to crystallise and release the heat associated with this crystallisation Your guess regarding the half-dissolved crystals is correct - the crystals that have not dissolved act as seed crystals for further crystal growth You need to dissolve all of the crystals to prevent the process from spontaneously reversing Despite the popularity of this kind of reaction for modern self-heating food/drink packaging in Japan I suspect the discovery of this kind of reaction is lost to antiquity as for instance sodium acetate can be made by simply mixing salt and vinegar I recall reading that the highly exothermic reaction of calcium oxide and water was used in self-heating cans of food back in World War I
4473,chemistry,I had a poke around in an effort to determine the dye used in orange silica gel and was able to find two material safety datasheets (MSDSes) for orange silica gels which both gave different empirical formulae for the dye ( $\ce{C25H30ClN3}$ and $\ce{C20H14O4}$ ) which suggests that there are multiple formulations of orange/yellow silica gel Both of these dyes are organic molecules (as opposed to transition metal salts) and now their possible identities are given at the bottom of this response Suffice to say that orange silica gels were designed specifically to avoid the use of cobalt chloride which is fairly toxic As a document 1 from the US National Parks Service indicates the chief danger of cobalt chloride is its environmental toxicity if it enters soil or water through improper disposal Cobalt salts are often rather evil and this is actually reflected in the name which is ostensibly an alteration of 'kobold' However as long as the beads are kept in a suitable enclosure such as a filtered dessicator plug they should not present a hazard Inhalation of dust from the silica gel beads direct handling of beads or cobalt chloride-impregnated materials or complete inundation of the dessicant (which could dissolve some of the cobalt chloride) are three possible ways the cobalt chloride could present a direct hazard but the disposal of blue silica gel-containing products in landfill and subsequent leaching of cobalt chloride is probably the chief concern As far as the orange beads go as I was not able to determine the specific indicator molecule(s) I can't ascertain their toxicity suffice to say that they are by design less harmful than cobalt chloride and appear to be generally considered safe under normal use P S (finally after chrome crashing multiple times) F'x points out that $\ce{[C25H30N3]^{+}Cl^{-}}$ is crystal violet which is not super toxic but for which there is evidence of carcinogenicity 2 and which is considered an environmental pollutant $\ce{C20H14O4}$ may very well be phenolphthalein which is considered to be a carcinogen by some authorities most notably appearing on the California Prop 65 listing 3 I guess the idea is that cobalt chloride is less desirable than either of these dyes Don't eat the beads and wash your hands (1) U S National Park Service; Cobalt Indicating Silica Gel Health and Safety Update; 2005 pp 1-3 (2) Littlefield N A ; Blackwell B -N ; Hewitt C C ; Gaylor D w ; Chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies of gentian violet in mice; Fundamental and Applied Toxicology 2004 pp 902-912 (3) Chemicals Known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity; State of California EPA; March 16 2012 p 17
14363,chemistry,Unfortunately there are no (or only very hard to find) studies to the mechanism of the actual sorption of arsenic (acids) to magnetite Most literature does describe it as a simple Ligand exchange although I find that hard to believe From what I have read ( 1 2 3 = 3en 4 ) I will try to compose some hints on what may happen First of all lets have a look at arsenic acid It is a medium strong acid and a quite well oxidising agent \begin{aligned}\ce{ H3AsO4 &amp;\equiv AsO(OH)3\\ AsO(OH)3 + H2O &amp;&lt;=&gt; H3+O + AsO2^{-}(OH)2\\ AsO(OH)3 + 2H3+O + 2e- &amp;&lt;=&gt; As(OH)3 + 3H2O }\end{aligned} In presence of any electron rich material and acidic environment it will therefore not be unusual that arsenous acid will be formed (Fn 1) We may therefore also focus on this amphoteric molecule \begin{aligned}\ce{ H3AsO3 &amp;\equiv As(OH)3\\ As(OH)3 + H3+O &amp;&lt;=&gt; As+(OH)2 + 2H2O\\ As(OH)3 + {}^{-}OH &amp;&lt;=&gt; AsO^{-}(OH)2 + H2O }\end{aligned} Depending on the pH of the solution one would expect to find many of different of these species Arsenic is also somewhat oxophil meaning that the $\ce{As-O}$-bond is quite strong The magnetite in aqueous solution reacts basic also forming complex like structures or hydroxides for example this fully hydrated cluster (ref 2 stoichiometry omitted) \begin{aligned}\ce{ Fe3O4 + x H2O &amp;&lt;=&gt; Fe2(OH)2(H2O)8^{4+} }\end{aligned} Of course one has to pay attention that the used ferric nano particles for sorpting arsen(o)ic acid(s) are far larger than the used model complex However we can see that there are functional groups like $\ce{-OH}$ or $\ce{-OH2+}$ (or maybe even $\ce{-O-}$) covering the surface Using this as prerequisites we can think about what might happen next I generally would suggest to start with physisorption i e the cluster and the acid molecules come in close range Since we are dealing with contaminated water it is maybe safe to assume that we can deal with soluble salts of arsenoic acid hence focusing on $\ce{AsO3^{3-}}$ When the complexes come into close range hydrogen bonds will form with $\ce{&gt;Fe}$ being the nano particle $$\ce{&gt;Fe-OH\cdots{}O-AsO2^{3-}}$$ Since the whole surface is covered with hydroxide groups several of these hydrogen bonds may form As we can see with this we may now enter the realm of chemisorption Once these complexes have formed it is from an entropic point of view favoured to release smaller molecules water in this case Also the oxygen atoms bound to arsenic are now in close range to iron atoms Since we are dealing with nano particle there will be non-coordinated irons in proximity This allows for a more permanent complet to form $$\ce{&gt;Fe-O-AsO^{3-}-O\cdots{}HO-Fe&lt;}$$ With this monodentate complex we have an already stable complex of a bound arsenic to an iron It is furthermore possible and probably favoured to form a bidentate complex with a somewhat similar mechanism Let us also consider a more basic scenario In this case the surface of the magnetite will not be entirely covered with hydroxide atoms but more freely accessible oxygen atoms will be present Direct bond formation between $\ce{&gt;Fe-O\cdots{}ASO3^{3-}}$ may occur <
4521,chemistry,I wish I could answer your question outright but this is outside my area of expertise The best I can give you is a place to start I expect any recent book on proteomics would cover this topic For example Introduction to Proteomics Principles and Applications (Methods of Biochemical Analysis) by Mishra and Blobel Wiley 2010 I found some promising papers with a little searching with SciFinder Neither I nor my institution subscribe to Protein Science but the abstract looks promising I have skimmed the article in PNAS Hopefully one of these articles has your answer Zhou et al Revisiting the Ramachandran plot from a new angle Protein Science 2011 1166-1171 Porter and Rose Redrawing the Ramachandran plot after inclusion of hydrogen-bonding constraints PNAS * 2011 108 1 109-112
4533,chemistry,This question has a simple but non-obvious answer DMSO and water are miscible Mixtures and in particular homogeneous ones like that formed by water and DMSO usually have lower melting (or more relevant in this case freezing) points than either substance does alone This is the reason salt melts ice the salt solution has a lower freezing point than pure water The physics behind this melting point depression are complex but a simple enough approximation involves disruption of the intermolecular forces holding the solid crystal lattice together Water freezes at 0 °C and DMSO freezes at 19 °C Mixtures of the two have lower freezing points More importantly mixtures of the two likely form less disruptive crystals when frozen Water is well know for having a solid state that is less dense than its liquid state Ice crystals take up more room than the liquid water they formed from Single water crystals can grow quite large especially as smaller crystals merge Additionally water crystals tend to form this hexagonal fractal pattern (snowflakes) which have pointy bits DMSO even at the 10% by weight customarily used must prevent such large disruptive crystals from forming especially when the everything is cooled to -80 °C DMSO is used for this purpose instead of other water-miscible liquids such as ethanol because it has very low toxicity
4478,chemistry,The enthalpy is not additive under isobar adiabatic conditions for non-ideal mixtures The change in the enthalpy is called the excess enthalpy (enthalpy of mixing) It can be computed with models such as the Margules van Laar Wilson NRTL and UNIQUAC These model give equations for the excess Gibbs energy The excess enthalpy can be derived from these as described in 6 2 Fundamental Relations of Excess Functions in Molecular Thermodynamics of Fluid-Phase Equilibria (3rd Edition) (F'x already referred to this excellent book ) One has to be careful with the conflicting sign convetions in the literature
4481,chemistry,Can you explain what the crystal is Based on the common colors you describe and the Regeneration I would think that the crystal you are describing is just a basic Desiccant (like a silica gel it's hygroscopic it absorbs water) Most desiccants are pretty harmless (never heard of any issues with common ones used in consumer goods) You really need to add more information to your description What is the make (in case someone wants to look it up) The biggest danger I can think of with a portable dehumidifier is bacterial/fungal growth Both of these can give off a smell it could be that when regenerating the crystal (which if it's a desiccant like I think would mean heating it is actually cooking the growth creating a smell (But this is me trying to image what could potentially cause that smell not what is happening) Again not enough information to reach any conclusion (But I do think you are describing a desiccant)
4486,chemistry,These illustrations are by David Goodsell and carry his famous look Whilst I was not able to determine what specific software he uses this page suggests that he probably creates his illustrations as a composite of renders and that the outlines and depth cueing are achieved by running a 'find edges' filter over the z-buffer of the scene which can be output from many renderers VMD is a fairly powerful program (that F'x has contributed patches to ) capable of achieving this cel-shaded look with minimal postprocessing by using a GLSL Fresnel shader As F'x mentioned QuteMol can do this style as well however QuteMol has not been actively developed since about 2007 and is not terribly feature-rich which is a shame as it's one of very few molecule viewers with competent ambient occlusion How to do it with VMD and Blender In the first instance I tried using the GLSL shader Goodsell style in VMD on the PDB file 1RON a neuropeptide I was not satisfied with the results but this would probably look decent on a protein SES as illustrated on the aforementioned VMD site Note that I have used 2 VMD representations to separate out the style of the backbone and the sidechains minus the hydrogens I'm not going for a 1-to-1 clone of the referred style just something thematically similar I have shrunk this VMD output down because as F'x pointed out in chat GLSL shaded spheres are not antialiased This said if you are very tricky you might be able to force antialiasing using a shader method like FXAA which can be enabled in arbitrary programs in the very latest nVidia beta drivers (I know ) Alternatively you can do what I did and manually oversample D Next step - Blender I output the VdW spheres as two separate VRML files one for the backbone one for the sidechains These can be imported into Blender I'm going to assume proficiency with Blender however if you are not familiar Blender is fairly easy to learn especially versions 2 5 and later I've combined the VdW sphere meshes of each component into a backbone and sidechain object assigned materials for each (just changing the colours of the default diffuse shader) and have applied one level of Catmull-Clarke subdivision to the meshes to make the spheres more spherical than the default I've also removed the light source and turned on environmental lighting which lights the scene isotropically and will generate some nice ambient occlusion while we're at it I now render this at high resolution obtaining a standard render and the Z-buffer for the scene I've scaled them down here Note that if you want the spheres to be a flat colour you should set the material to 'shadeless' I like the subtly shaded look better Oh yeah that looks nice And here's the Z-buffer Regrettably the Z-buffer in blender has no antialiasing which is why I've rendered things huge and scaled down in Photoshop I now run the Glowing
23845,chemistry,Just browsing through this Unanswered Question now (in late 2014) I hope it's not too late In protein structure validation Ramachandran outliers are a strong but not absolute indicator that the backbone confirmation of your protein structure deviates from all the high resolution structures known to date and hence need your attention during the progress of refinement If all the phi-psi angles (backbone conformation) all fall into the allowed/favoured regions on the Ramachandran plot your structure model is probably but not necessarily esp in the case of low resolution correct Hence there are other weaker criteria in protein structure validation and Cbeta deviation is just one of them In the light of high resolution structures out there it turns out that Cbeta also has a favoured range of dihedral angles suggesting that any misfit between your structure and the probable side chain-backbone conformation also deserves your attention during structure refinement In MolProbity the justification and validation procedure are described here
4489,chemistry,The formation of bonds nearly always leads to a decrease in energy This is desirable since less energy $\implies$ stability so wherever it is possible bonds tend to form $\ce{H+}$ has an empty $s$ orbital $\ce{H2O{ }}$ has a lone pair These easily form something akin to a dative bond ($\ce{H2O{ }\bond{-&gt;}H+}$) giving $\ce{H3O+}$ Note that there is no single positively charged hydrogen--the charge is distributed over the entire molecule Distribution of charge leads to more stability Now $\ce{H9O4+}$ (called the Eigen cation ) is even stranger You can imagine it like this Three $\ce{H2O}$ molecules approach $\ce{H3O+}$ (remember this cation is positively charged and water has a lone pair which is attracted to positive charge) Basically charge-dipole attraction Of course the lone pair will point towards the hydronium Now these charge-dipole attraction bonds resonate The hydrogens of the central hydronium detach from the main molecule and attach to the peripheral ones In reality the electron cloud is delocalised and we have partial bonds Now the charge is distributed even more We can have other species like $\ce{H7O3+}$ $\ce{H15O7+}$ etc Note that there are crowding issues as well - this is why $\ce{H_{103}O_{51}+}$ probably doesn't exist Basically the original $\ce{H+}$ is being solvated The solvation delocalises the charge and forms extra bonds reducing the net potential energy and increasing stability That's basically it It's similar to what happens when you dissolve any ionic compound in water
5149,chemistry,The reaction you propose would be formally equivalent to the protection of aldehydes with 1 3-propanedithiol to form the correspondent dithiane There are many organic reactions in which aldehydes participate this way but all of them have something in common the other species(lets call it donor) must have a free pair of electrons to attack the carbon atom in the aldehyde In case this pair is not present but the donor has an acidic hydrogen we could use a strong base to remove it and form in situ the pair of electrons (See aldol reactions ) Here's the problem diamonds have no free pairs of electrons And terminal hydrogens in a diamond lattice are by no means acidic hence can't be removed by any base to the best of my knowledge So there's no way a diamond will react with aldehydes
4517,chemistry,This answer to a question about the solubility of silver nitrate and silver chloride will give you a good starting point to answer your question In order to dissolve a salt you have to break apart the ions and hydrate them in solution You can use the enthalpies of hydration of the ions and the crystal lattice energy of the solid to predict which compounds will dissolve There is quite a nice discussion about how to think about solubilities of salts and what factors affect solubility using a Born-Haber cycle in this reference The values for enthalpies of hydration and crystal lattice energies of sodium chloride and calcium fluoride can be found in standard chemistry texts or with an on-line search If you have more questions after looking at this material come back and ask for clarification
4505,chemistry,Fluorous solvents have the odd property of being both hydrophobic and lipophobic ( Ref ) and thus are not miscible with either aqueous or many organic solvents as you've noted Fluorine as the most electronegative element does odd things to a molecule (and is often used in pharmaceutical compounds just because of some of these odd properties) In the perfluorinated hydrocarbons the carbon-fluorine bonds are quite polar with the electron density higher toward the fluorine The solvents themselves however are not polar due to free rotation about the C-C bonds so they are not miscible with polar solvents and are hydrophobic Because the F is so electronegative the electrons are quite tightly held and the molecules have a low polarizability and unusually weak London dispersion forces so they aren't miscible with non-polar solvents either These weak London forces are illustrated by the fact that the perfluorinated hydrocarbons have nearly the same boiling point as their corresponding normal hydrocarbon despite having more mass ( Ref ) You mentioned heat as one way to render the organic and fluorous solvents miscible Adding gaseous $\ce{CO2}$ to the biphasic system also makes the phases miscible in many cases due to the high solubility of $\ce{CO2}$ in both fluorous and organic solvents ( Ref ) This reference suggest that shape may also be a consideration when considering flourous solvent's miscibility with alkanes also through poor/weak interaction of London dispersion forces in the two liquids
4504,chemistry,This is a very good question These compounds have been studied for long enough that most people working with them know the answers to these questions but the answers are buried in physical chemistry articles from 20 or more years ago The imidazolium tetrafluoroborate salts are popular RTILs because 1) they have the right properties and 2) they are easy to make Concerning these compounds having the right properties Most RTILs require two characteristics in the their constituent ions to minimize the intermolecular order which would cause them to solidify First they need a cation-anion pair that cannot associate strongly and second they need to have lower symmetry Immidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BF 4 - ) salts have both of these The aromaticity of imidazole is important The positive charge of the imidazolium cation is distributed through the resonance of the aromatic pi system The negative charge in BF 4 - is distributed inductively over the four fluorine atoms Additionally imidazolium is planar and BF 4 - is spherical Both the diffuse charge distribution and poor shape match prevent these two ions from having a strong association The two different alkyl groups (ethyl and methyl) on the imidazolium ring are enough to break the symmetry of the system and prevent more efficient packing which would lead to the substance being solid Concerning their ease of synthesis The imidazolium salts are easy to prepare from imidazole and various alkyl halides all commercially available and inexpensive The predominance of the BF 4 - anion is also a result of the synthesis The synthesis of an imidazolium salt RTIL begins with imidazole and and an alkyl halide say chloromethane The product of this step is 1-methylimidazolium chloride This salt is reacted with another alkyl halide say chloroethane in the presence of a base say triethylamine The products of the this step are 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and triethylammonium chloride 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride is a solid because the chloride ion is small with concentrated charge The tetrafluoroborate salt is prepared by salt metathesis 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride is dissolved in water and an aqueous solution of silver tetrafluoroborate (AgBF 4 ) is added Silver chloride AgCl is virtually insoluble in water ( K sp = 1 77 x 10 -10 ) and precipitates The solution is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated to produce 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM BF 4 - ) AgBF 4 and AgPF 6 are commercially available so you will see those ions more frequently The other ions while they have good properties for ionic liquids are not usually available as silver salts so those reagents have to be prepared You are already doing three reactions to get to EMIM BF 4 - Who wants to do more synthesis just to make their solvents
4502,chemistry,Okay let's answer bit by bit Measurement of heat capacity of liquids this isn't particularly hard to do and in fact it's much easier to obtain $C_p$ experimentally than $C_V$… however once you know one the other can be determined from it and some other thermodynamic properties Different types of calorimeters are used for liquids but the best-known is probably the Callender and Barnes apparatus “Does an accepted value exist ” and “Is the specific heat of liquid iron temperature-dependent ” — Well I found a good paper which includes measurements and comparison with previously published values Thermophysical Properties of Liquid Iron M Beutl G Pottlacher and H Jäger Intl J Thermophys 1994 15 1323              which confirms that considering that heat capacity is roughly constant in the 1800–4000 K range The authors thus extract the constant pressure specific heat capacity as 825 J/kg/K apparently in reasonable agreement with previous work that they cite   “Or am I a poor researcher ” — Well the above paper is the first result return by Google for a search for specific heat and liquid iron so I'll let you be the judge of that ;-)
4503,chemistry,Well if you assume the rates are known and the reactions' order follows from stoechiometry (e g if they are elementary reactions) you can put the chemical kinetics into simple equations $$\frac{da}{dt} = -k_1 a(t)^2 - k_3 a(t)b(t) $$ $$\frac{db}{dt} = -k_2 b(t)^2 - k_3 a(t)b(t) $$ ($t$ here being time not temperature) Knowing initial amounts or concentrations $a_0=a(t=0)$ and $b_0=b(t=0)$ you can pretty much integrate the system to find out what happens Edit — solving this system for $k_1=k_2=k_3$ yields the quantities of AA AB and BB at infinite time to be as follows $$aa = \frac{a_0^2}{a_0+b_0}$$ $$ab = \frac{a_0 b_0}{a_0+b_0}$$ $$bb = \frac{b_0^2}{a_0+b_0}$$
4508,chemistry,This is one of the tricky parts in the nomenclature of fused cyclic systems Excerpt from page 180 of the 1998 IUPAC Nomenclature of fused and bridged fused ring systems (I have added bold to the piece of importance to answer your question) The numbering of the peripheral atoms in a particular orientation starts from the uppermost ring If there is more than one uppermost ring the ring furthest to the right is chosen Numbering starts from the non-fusion atom most counterclockwise in the ring selected and numbering proceeds in a clockwise direction around the system including fusion heteroatoms Fusion carbon atoms are not included ; each fusion carbon atom is given the same number as the immediately preceding position modified by a roman letter a b c etc If heteroatoms are identified by replacement nomenclature all atoms retain the numbers of the parent hydrocarbon If one considers coumarin this is not the IUPAC nomenclature but the numbering rule remains the same Below is an example of the numbering scheme for coumarin which summarizes why the substituents are numbered by this manner on coumarin
4511,chemistry,(Assuming this is homework or self-education which should be treated homeworky) 1) why we are not adding the contribution of water to the H3O+ ions Write down the dissociation constant equation with and without $\ce{H2O}$ What changes Can you find a formulation of the dissociation constant where it seems natural not to include $\ce{H2O}$ Read up activity 2) why we are assuming that the value 0 02x is dissociated from HF and not just x Write down &amp; solve the equation with 0 02 x and with x only What is the difference
4515,chemistry,You're right the silver is reacting with sulphur compounds in the food to form a tarnish of silver sulphide This is most commonly observed in my experience using silver teaspoons with boiled eggs which are pretty rich in sulphur There are a number of reactions that can take place depending on the sulphur-containing species - the abstract from this paper from the Journal of Chemical Education (unfortunately pay-walled) has a nice example Silver and silver-plated objects react with sulfur and sulfur compounds to produce silver sulfide (Ag2S) or tarnish Contact with materials that contain sulfur compounds such as hardboiled eggs mayonnaise mustard and rubber bands can cause tarnish In air a silver object can tarnish owing to the reaction of silver with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) This is a gas found in the air as a result of some industrial processes and the decomposition of dead plants and animals The reaction of silver with hydrogen sulfide to form tarnish is as follows $\ce{2 Ag(s) + H2S(g) -&gt; Ag2S(s) + H2(g)}$ In Sterling silver specifically you'll often also get copper sulphide formed The paper also mentions that you can remove the tarnish abrasively or through reacting the tarnish with aluminium ( via solution electrochemically) $\ce{3 Ag2S(s) + 2 Al(s) -&gt; 6 Ag(s) + Al2S3(s)}$ But a more common approach used by many commercial products is to dissolve off the tarnish usually in sodium thiosulphate or thiourea This means you end up with slightly less silver on your item but is otherwise pretty effective and very mild (it's commonly used for museum pieces )
4522,chemistry,Yeah dimers of noble gas atoms are stable due to dispersion aka London forces More generally neutral non-polar molecules can still form very weak bound states arising entirely from the induction and interaction of instantaneous dipole moments (that is fluctuations in the electron density around an atom arising from the motion of electrons) My understanding is that physicists would explain this interaction as a special case of the Casimir-Polder interaction This interaction means that even noble gases are nonideal Correctly predicting the negative interaction energy of a noble gas dimer is a pathological test of dispersion-corrected DFT functionals as F'x's reference 1 and the references therein indicate and many methods fail qualitatively I recall that Zhao and Truhlar used noble gas dimers to test the efficacy of their various metahybrid functionals 2 3 One of their papers 2 makes reference to a table of binding energies and equilibrium distances derived 4 by Wang and Ogilvy giving for instance a $\ce{Ne\cdots{}Ne}$ binding energy of 0 35 kJ mol -1 (that's tiny) and less than half that for $\ce{He\cdots{}Ne}$ The $\ce{Ne\cdots{}Ne}$ equilibrium distance is given as 309 pm which is extreme As the paper 5 you refer to indicates however the interaction energy for the $\ce{^4He\cdots{}^4He}$ dimer is much much smaller than either of these and has an equilibrium distance of 5 2 nm ( ) which is something else entirely (1) Ruzsinszky A ; Perdew J P ; Csonka G I ; Binding Energy Curves from Nonempirical Density Functionals II van der Waals Bonds in Rare-Gas and Alkaline-Earth Diatomics ; J Phys Chem A; 2005 109 pp 11015-11021 (2) Zhao Y ; Truhlar D G ; Hybrid Meta Density Functional Theory Methods for Thermochemistry Thermochemical Kinetics and Noncovalent Interactions The MPW1B95 and MPWB1K Models and Comparative Assessments for Hydrogen Bonding and van der Waals Interactions ; J Phys Chem A; 2004 108 6908-6918 (3) Zhao Y ; Truhlar D G ; Comparative DFT Study of van der Waals Complexes Rare-Gas Dimers Alkaline-Earth Dimers Zinc Dimer and Zinc-Rare-Gas Dimers ; J Phys Chem A; 2006 110 pp 5121-5129 (4) Ogilvie J F ; Wang F Y H ; Potential-energy functions of diatomic molecules of the noble gases II Unlike nuclear species ; J Mol Struct ; 1993 291 pp 313-322 (5) Grisenti R E ; Schöllkopf W ; Toennies J P ; Hegerfeldt G C ; Köhler T ; Stoll M ; Determination of the Bond Length and Binding Energy of the Helium Dimer by Diffraction from a Transmission Grating ; Phys Rev Lett ; 2000 85 pp 2284-2287
4529,chemistry,There are electrophoretic methods where the molecules stop automatically like Isoelectric Focusing but in the common agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA you mention this is not the case The DNA is negatively charged it will move along the electric field you set up until you stop applying any current It will happily move out of your gel if you let it run for too long To see the progress of your gel some dyes are usually added to the sample like bromophenol blue or xylene cyanol They don't interact with the DNA they just provide you a reference on how far your gel has run You still need to have a rough idea how your samples run compared to those dyes if you want to use the full length of your gel
4528,chemistry,You get a better resolution in the indirect dimension with an HSQC compared to a HMQC You usually also get a higher signal to noise ratio for the HMQC (see figure 15 in this review for a comparison ) The HSQC signal is a singlet while the HMQC is usually a multiplet as you see certain couplings on it So generally you should prefer the HSQC over the HMQC One advantage of the HMBC is that is uses significantly fewer pulses than the HSQC This means that errors in the pulses don't accumulate as much as in the HSQC you'll lose less signal if your pulses are wrong than in the HSQC If you had trouble setting up an HSQC that could mean that the probe wasn't tuned and matched properly for your sample or that your pulse lengths were wrong The proton pulse should be determined on each sample individually the $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ and $\mathrm{^{15}N}$ pulses should be set up correctly already If you're not using a probe with automatic tuning and matching you should also do that manually before the measurement There are a lot more HSQC and HMQC variants that are used e g Sofast-HMQC or TROSY sequences that are used for larger molecules like proteins Another interesting variant you should consider is the multiplicity-edited HSQC where $\ce{CH2}$ signals will have the opposite sign from $\ce{CH}$ or $\ce{CH3}$ signals
4530,chemistry,I agree that the actual redox process is very fast The rate limiting issue with proteins and other macromolecues involves the reactive groups finding each other Thus from the time of translation to the time of disulfide formation the peptide chains need to fold properly Perhaps other subunits need to be assembled and attached Once everything is in the right place the disulfide bond should form quickly provided there is an appropriate oxidant present You could measure the rate of the entire process by attaching reporters to positions on the protein - say a fluorophore and a quencher When the process is complete the quencher and the fluorophore are close in space and fluorescence stops This approach will measure the overall rate of the entire process I am not sure if you can separate out the different components e g specifically the S-S bond forming I can't point to a specific paper where this is strategy is used since I am away from my usual computer that likes my journal subscriptions Hopefully I will be able to update my answer
4532,chemistry,Let us first define the terms needed here Degree of dissociation (DOD) Degree of dissociation is the fraction of a mole of the reactant that underwent dissociation It is represented by $\alpha$ Number of moles dissociated It is defined as the product of the initial concentration of the reactant and the degree of dissociation Now suppose you have a reaction like this $$\ce{A-&gt;B + C}$$ The initial state of A is always the concentration of A (should be given in the question) while initial moles of B and C are zero (if anything else is not specified) The final state of A is always defined as (number of moles initially present) - (Number of moles dissociated) while for B and C it is just ( number of moles of A dissociated) Writing our equation again A--------------&gt; B + C Initial moles a 0 0 Final moles a - a*(DOD) a*(DOD) a*(DOD) This should be quite simple If you need more clarification feel free to ask
4536,chemistry,I used F'x answer as a starting point and I found the mineral It's called Ulexite The fibers of ulexite act as optical fibers transmitting light along their lengths by internal reflection When a piece of ulexite is cut with flat polished faces perpendicular to the orientation of the fibers a good-quality specimen will display an image of whatever surface is adjacent to its other side (as shown in the photograph)
4538,chemistry,All quoted stuff copied from IUPAC Red Book IR-4 unless otherwise specified It's not only $\ce{H3AsO3}$ What about $\ce{H3BO3 H3PO4 H2SO4 HClO4}$ Or indeed any other oxyacid Basically we have multiple ways of writing inline formulae of covalent compounds One is the boring way ( molecular formula ) and one is the fun way ( structural formula ) where the formula reveals a bit of the structure $\ce{As(OH)3}$ reveals the structure $\ce{H3AsO3}$ doesn't For compounds consisting of discrete molecules the molecular formula as opposed to the empirical formula may be used to indicate the actual composition of the molecules For the order of citation of symbols in molecular formulae see Section IR-4 4 A structural formula gives partial or complete information about the way in which the atoms in a molecule are connected and arranged in space In simple cases a line formula that is just a sequence of atomic symbols gives structural information provided the reader knows that the formula represents the order of the atoms in the linear structure So what are the rules for writing the molecular formula Well initially these rules were basically that we just follow electronegativity--the most electropositive element is listed first and so on Looks like they slightly changed it For one there are actually two ordering standards--one is the extremely boring alphabetical one which I've never seen used (except in emperical formulae) and one is via electronegativity Now instead of following the absolute electronegativities the IUPAC has assigned a pseudo-electronegativity order (my terminology) The rules are as follows (source) for two elements in different groups - then the element in the higher numbered group has higher electronegativity for two elements within the same group the element with the lower the atomic number has the higher electronegativity Hydrogen is fitted in to be less electronegative than polonium and more electronegative than nitrogen Hence the formulae of water and ammonia can be written H2O and NH3 respectively This leads to the following pseudo-electronegativity order of elements (click to enlarge) The motivation behind this must probably be the erratic and hard-to-quantify nature of real enectronegativity Now we can apply these rules in the following way If the compound is a binary compound (only two elements not two atoms) then we just follow the pseudo-electronegativity thingy In accordance with established practice the electronegativity criterion (Section IR-4 4 2 1) is most often used in binary species If the compound is a coordination compound we order central atoms by pseudo-electronegativity and ligands by alphabetical order as written (eg $\ce{(en)}$ before $\ce{(dmg)}$ but $\ce{C2H4(NH2)2}$ after $\ce{(dmg)}$ even though
4541,chemistry,The notation refers to the valency (number of the phosphorous's valence electrons involved in bonds i e either 3 or 5) and coordination number (number of substituents attached) in organophosphorous compounds For example it could refer to tautomeric forms phosphonate esters as shown below from this source So the ?3 ?3 refers to a P with 3 bonding valence electrons (the lone pair doesn't count) and 3 substituents attached while ?5 ?3 refers to a P with all five of it's valence electrons involved in bonds and 4 substituents attached
4571,chemistry,It sounds like you need a solvent that 1) does not react with KMnO 4 and 2) is immiscible with water As @Janice DelMar said in her comment some of the lower-chlorinated hydrocarbons (methylene chloride 1 2-dichloroethane 1 1 2-trichloroethane) should work If you can live with a high boiling point solvent you might consider chlorobenzene Other solvents that fit these criteria include most alkanes (pentane hexane cyclohexane petroleum ether etc ) benzene (but not toluene) and diethyl ether A quick test to determine compatibility of your solvent with KMnO 4 involves a TLC stain Make (or borrow) a batch of KMnO 4 stain as described here Dip a TLC plate into your solvent and then dip it into the stain with minimal drying between If the plate turns brown (MnO 2 ) then your solvent was oxidized and is no good If the plate stays purple then your solvent is resistant
4545,chemistry,Wikipedia already offers a decent summary of two theories of shear thickening behavior - namely the generation of transient 'defects' in a high-density suspension that either resist further growth or are incompressible in the direction of shear A potential macroscale analogue of shear thickening is the dramatic increase in viscosity of large particle-air mixtures upon pneumatic removal of the interparticle fluid as is exploited in jamming skin enabled locomotion (paper here ) This should be roughly comparable to the transient decrease in particle spacing in a shear thickening fluid that is being compressed beyond its relaxation rate
4547,chemistry,[Manishearth I'm not sure I'm even answering the right question below After reading your question more carefully I think you were more interested in how water molecules help crystals form rather than whether or not the anhydrous forms can form crystals also (versus being strictly amorphous) So oops Maybe some one else has a good answer on the water molecules part ] I suspect the answer is an issue of process rather than of fundamentals That is if you could find a non-aqueous medium that readily dissolves the anhydrous form of some salt my very strong suspicion is that you could grow excellent clear crystals of it that would look almost nothing like the hydrous crystalline forms The problem for metallic-anion salts in particular is that finding a liquid that dissolves the salt without simultaneously forming strong coordination complexes with it is going to be tricky since I'm guessing it's usually the coordination effect that help ionize the units of the material to make it soluble Here's a wild guess Someone somewhere has likely done research on how to grow crystals of substances such as anhydrous $\ce{CaSO4}$ (hmm why does this phrase dead burnt plaster come to mind ) or anhydrous $\ce{CuSO4}$ by using low-temperature molten solutions of something or other Not sure what And what a delightful crystal that would be to have It would be way out of the ordinary despite being so very ordinary in one sense in its composition Update Apparently clear crystals of anhydrous $\ce{CuSO4}$ do indeed exist and are easier to create than I thought You just add concentrated sulfuric acid [a] to ordinary copper sulphate pentahydrate solution and let it evaporate slowly Since $\ce{H2SO4}$ is one of the most aggressive drying agents in existence my guess is that the $\ce{CuSO4}$ just can't compete for the remaining water molecules and is forced to crystallize without hydration [a] Please never ever attempt to use concentrated $\ce{H2SO4}$anywhere except in a real lab with protections and procedures fully in place This is a compound that wants water so badly that it willy synthesize water right out of the hydrogen and oxygen bonded into proteins and carbohydrates leaving only charred carbon Ironically the actual acidity of concentrated (vs hydrated) $\ce{H2SO4}$ is quite moderate comparable to that of vinegar Addenda -- Another common-exotic crystal may be lithium fluoride $\ce{LiF}$ although the accuracy of that seems to depend on who you read Unique how you say Even though lithium was an early result of the Big Bang lithium and fluorine are both consumed rapidly by large hot stars especially fluorine Their existence on earth thus appears to depend on processes such as proton irradiation and possibly even intensive neutrino irradiation tht only occur during the explosion of a supernova star rather than being inherited from before the cataclysmic event Pretty much all of the elements (except $\ce{H}$) here on Earth are star-forged of course but the elements in $\ce{LiF}$ crystals thus may be remnants of the supernova event itself That would cool ) -- And speaking of unique wearable crystals I've always wondered if there's a market out there for diamond crystals synthesized using carbon that was captured as carbon dioxide during the cremation of a loved one If there is feel free -- that is definitely not my bailiwick
8477,chemistry,I would say the answer on this website is pretty near perfect To summarize you need 2 things Enough friction between your nose and the spoon The center of mass of the spoon should be on a line vertically downwards THROUGH the tip of your nose as illustrated in this image from the same website The friction is highest if both your skin and the spoon are free of greasy `lubricants' Breathing on the spoon will add more friction by depositing a very thin (only a few atomic layers) film of water which on this scale behaves solid-like due to ordering effects as shown in this paper
4720,chemistry,The van der Waals equation can't be derived from first principles It is an ad-hoc formula There is a derivation in statistical mechanics from a partition function that is engineered to give the right answer It also cannot be derived from first principles A gas is a collection of molecules that do not cohere strongly enough to form a liquid or a solid The volume of a gas is as long as the molecules fit into it the volume of the container holding the gas In other words the volume of a gas is NOT a property of the gas directly but a property of the container
4551,chemistry,If you have the raw data (the FIDs in the ser file) still available there is no reason to use a Hilbert transformation you can just process with xfb instead of xfb n again xfb n also doesn't really discard the imaginary part it processes the spectrum from the raw data again but doesn't save the imaginary processed data The ser file contains all the recorded FIDs that data is sufficient (together with the parameter files) to recreate the full spectrum That your Topspin processes 2D spectra automatically is just some specific configuration it doesn't do that by default As far as I understand it if you zero-fill your data at least once all the information content of the imaginary part is then present in the real part of the processed spectrum So I'd guess that under those conditions the Hilbert transformation shouldn't have any downside but I'm not totally sure about that
4557,chemistry,Disclaimer This is not for the faint-hearted If you are not interested in using LaTeX stop reading now as this uses the media15 or movie9 packages to embed U3D in a pdfLaTeX generated PDF This answer assumes basic familiarity with LaTeX I have tested this with pdfLaTeX and it should work fine in XeLaTeX One of the tools I have used (DAZ Studio) is apparently 'free for a limited time' It is also not available on Linux FOSS replacement suggestions are welcome I'm of the personal opinion that 3D in PDF is not as good as it sounds What doesn't work VMD offers the ability to output as OBJ which can then be processed with FOSS MeshLab into a U3D file that can be embedded into a PDF This is sub-optimal for two reasons There is no way to tell MeshLab that the VMD-generated mesh is supposed to be Gouraud-shaded This means that the hard facets of the mesh will be glaringly obvious in the pdf even if you use an unwieldy degree of subdivision Colours are not preserved Your model will appear in the PDF with a uniform grey texture As such MeshLab is not suitable at this stage Preparing a model VMD offers a number of decent export options to get our geometry out of PDB or what have you and into a mesh format I opted to use the VRML format to output a mesh of a ribbon representation of PDB entry 4DM9 I then imported this into Blender Blender has no reliable U3D export capabilities however I can use it to assign Gouraud shading to all of the shapes and assign colours to them I then use the blender export function to export the scene as a Wavefront OBJ file with attendant MTL file Processing with DAZ Studio I am indebted to the author of this article (John Nyquist) which indicated that DAZ Studio can convert Wavefront to U3D just fine with preservation of textures DAZ is a very specific program that seems to be heavily geared towards posing clothing and rendering humanoid figures in the spirit of programs like Poser However all we really need is the U3D export function and we can read in the structure just fine Sometimes this is how I see myself Okay in all seriousness don't put a human figure in or on your molecule without good reason Export as U3D and then we can embed in pdfLaTeX pdfLaTeX and movie9 As a proof of concept I just followed the minimal example given in the media9 manual for getting a 3D model into a pdfLaTeX-generated PDF Here it is being viewed in Adobe Reader X (I know I know ) Bear in mind that very few readers can actually display 3D PDF which is one of the reasons why I feel that it is not such a good idea for chemical visualisation It starts off zoomed way too far in because I did not set up any options for the import (however you can find out all about that in the media9 or movie15 package manuals) and is a bit laggy on account of having
4556,chemistry,The citric acid in lemon juice hydrolyzes the sucrose molecules into glucose and fructose as you heat the sugar The water in the lemon juice is also part of this process This mixture of monosaccharides is much less crystalline in the same way that most mixtures are less crystalline than pure substances Wikipedia has a good article on this process under the title Inverted sugar syrup The syrup is inverted in the sense that the sign of its optical rotation has changed because sucrose has a large positive optical rotation while fructose has a large negative optical rotation Glucose has a positive optical rotation but of a lower magnitude than sucrose The reaction is $$\ce{C12H22O11}(sucrose)+\ce{H2O -&gt; C6H12O6}(glucose)+\ce{C6H12O6}(fructose)$$ The reaction can occur to a small degree by simply heating sugar with water in absence of acid catalysis I assume the acid is necessary to get good conversion before you burn your sugar or vaporize all of the water Honey is a naturally occuring inverted sugar syrup of this type Honey is resistant to crystallization because it is a mixture of gluclose and fructose Honey is also slightly acidic
4567,chemistry,Menthol it self gives a cold feeling in the mouth because it is active at the same receptor (an ion channel) on the tongue that cold temperature triggers Interestingly although they act at the same receptor they act at different sites so that provides the intensified response when eating a mint and then drinking water This reference gives an excellent detailed answer with references to the original papers which I'll summarize here Menthol acts at the TRPM8 protein which forms an ion channel that allows $\ce{Na+}$ and $\ce{Ca^2+}$ ions to flow into cells and this sends a signal saying cool to the brain (As an aside this protein monitors temperature across the body and not just on the tongue ) Cold temperatures actually change the confirmation of this protein which allows the ions to flow more freely and sends the signal to the brain Menthol on the other hand stabilizes the open channel (allowing ions to flow even more freely) and also “menthol shifts the voltage dependence of channel activation to more negative values by slowing channel deactivation” This is very significant to my question because it supports a claim made by the first web page I visited which stated that menthol acts on the receptors leaving them sensitized for when the second stimulus is applied (i e cold water) resulting in the enhanced sensation This mechanism of binding is very clearly different from the mechanism of cold affecting the TRP channels This is why the sensation is increased when both stimuli are applied yet is not affected after addition stimulation from the same stimuli (i e eating another mint) All in all pretty cool
4564,chemistry,Raise hell with the grader There's no reason whatsoever for this answer to be rejected A Google book search can substantiate your argument and the first example from a textbook is actually in your order           I think the guidance “allow single arrow in either direction” is not exclusive with “allow double arrows in either order” and maybe only single arrows were explicitly mentionned because it was obvious to the writer that order in double arrows doesn't matter
4583,chemistry,There are several reasons why $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ experiments are far less sensitive than proton experiments The natural abundance for $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ is only 1 1% while $\mathrm{^{1}H}$ has a natural abundance of 99 9% This difference alone means that if you don't label your sample with $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ the spectra will be around 90 times less sensitive than proton spectra due to the lower natural abundance alone $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ also has a four times lower gyromagnetic ration than $\mathrm{^{1}H}$ which also lowers the sensitivity But the way the experiment is usually measured you get magnetization transfer from directly-attached protons to the carbons which increases the sensitivity $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ also relaxes more slowly which means that the time between experiments is longer and you can measure fewer scans than for proton experiments in the same time Another factor that is important is which kind of probe your spectrometer is using For an inverse probe like e g a Bruker TXI the inner coil is the proton coil which means it's especially suited for proton experiments For $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ experiments an observe probe like a BBO is more sensitive as the carbon is measured on the inner coil If you have multiple spectrometers you should ask which one is better suited for $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ experiments If you have a very small amount of sample a Shigemi tube allows you to measure in half the sample volume (200-250 $\mu$l) compared to standard tubes you can achieve a higher concentration that way They're pretty expensive though and they have to be matched to the solvent so you would need a CDCl3 tube And there are various problems that could drastically reduce your sensitivity for $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ the most important ones if we disregard hardware problems are proper tuning and matching for $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ and the correct pulse length for $\mathrm{^{13}C}$ I've avoided your actual question as the required concentration depends on quite a few factors I'd recommend you to ask the person responsible for the spectrometers as they should be able to give you a better estimate based on the actual hardware you have
4568,chemistry,Macromolecular NMR spectra are difficult to compute because macromolecular electronic structures are computationally expensive to solve with accuracy Obtaining precise chemical shifts and splitting requires accurate treatment of electron density and geometry especially for simulation of NOESY which I understand is important in macromolecular structural elucidation This requires good methodology and large basis sets An interesting case study by Saielli and Bagno demonstrates the use of DFT (with cc-PVTZ basis) in predicting NMR spectra for two candidate structures and the correlating them with experimental data however the mean error in chemical shifts is nontrivial 1 (0 2 ppm in the best match) The same people do $^{1}\ce{H}$ and $\ce{^{13}C}$ NMR predictions of a number of complex molecules 2 (with intriguing discrepancies in shifts) however this is a far cry from predicting say a large protein $^{1}\ce{H}$ NMR spectrum I have seen EPR spectra of transition metal clusters simulated as abstract spin systems (for instance by EasySpin ) however I presume that this is very qualitative (1) Saielli G ; Bagno A ; Can two molecules have the same NMR spectrum Hexacyclinol revisited ; Org Lett ; (2009) 11 pp 1409-1412 (2) Bagno A ; Rastrelli F ; Saielli G ; Toward the complete prediction of the $\ce{^1H}$ and $\ce{^{13}C}$ NMR spectra of complex organic molecules by DFT methods Application to natural substances ; Chem Eur J ; (2006) 12 pp 5514-5525
4603,chemistry,I've never seen this reaction but it sounds quite entertaining And I learned a couple of new words in looking at the literature to explain this phenomenon Intumescence The property of a material to swell when heated Borax is intumescent Calcination is a thermal treatment process in presence of air applied to ores and other solid materials to bring about a thermal decomposition phase transition or removal of a volatile fraction The calcination process normally takes place at temperatures below the melting point of the product materials The mechanism for the calcination of borax quite complex and is covered in some detail in this article Borax decahydrate (BDH) $\ce{Na2B4O7 10H2O}$ is easily dehydrated to Borax pentahydrate (BPH) $\ce{Na2B4O7 5H2O}$ without much visible change The actual form of the borate ion in both BDH and BPH is $\ce{B4O5(OH)4^2-}$ with 2 of the water molecules actually incorporated as hydroxyl groups in the ion (The other 2 hydroxyl groups come for the water hydrogens and 2 oxygens from the $\ce{B4O7^2-}$ ) That means that the last two water molecules can only be removed by molecular decomposition So in BPH you actually have only 3 free (i e easy to remove) water molecules So here's what happens The borax decahydrate dehydrates smoothly with minimal density changes (no swelling) until you get to borax pentahydrate At this point the BPH dissolves in its own water of dehydration and the blossoming you see is from the solution erupting through the partially dehydrated crystal surface as it's heated The density of the borax changes dramatically as it goes from the pentahydrate (about $0 85 g/cm^3$) to the dihydrate (about $0 14 g/cm^3$) which is why it ends up looking whipped To do the final transformation to a tiny bead the remaining 2 waters of hydration (those tied up as hydroxide ions) are driven off as the $\ce{B4O5(OH)4^2-}$ decomposes to give metaborate $\ce{BO2^2-}$ and boric anhydride $\ce{B2O3}$ $$\ce{B4O5(OH)4^2- -&gt; 2 BO2 + B2O3 + 2H2O}$$ Fascinating
4582,chemistry,There are two big differences between the STD experiment and a NOESY that matter when aborting the experiment early The STD is usually run as a 1D experiment and it's using the phase cycle to substract the on- and off-resonance spectra from each other When you acquire a 1D spectrum with multiple scans the scans are not saved individually but directly added up to one FID at least on Bruker spectrometers So if you abort a 1D experiment (you need to execute tr to do that in most cases as the FID is only written to disk after all scans are finished in most pulse sequences) you can't just throw away the last incomplete phasy cycle And with experiments like the STD your actual signal is the difference of two larger signals so one incomplete substraction can ruin your spectrum In a 2D spectrum the increments for the indirect dimension are measured and written to disk sequentially so you can throw away the last incomplete increment if you would need to In most cases the incomplete increment will not be saved at all to disk so you'll end up with one less data point in the indirect dimension but no incomplete ones that were aborted in the middle of the phase cycle This depends on how exactly the pulse program is written but I suspect that most standard sequences handle it this way I've stopped HSQC and NOESY spectra before they were finished pretty often and never observed any artifacts that could be traced to the abortion of the experiment
4581,chemistry,A quick post so you can get started on thinking about this Remember resonance is just a model The electrons are delocalized all the time; the furan does not morph back and forth among the various structures You can do a formal evaluation of which resonance forms have the most contribution to the structure by looking at formal charges and there are rules to help you decide from the formal charges which resonance forms are most important If you're looking at reactivity the property you're interested in may not be that the one that is more stable is less reactive What you might look at instead is the consequences of attack at the 2 and 3 position look at the stability of the intermediates formed a more stable intermediate would tend to drive the reaction along that path After looking at these ideas feel free to come back with specific questions
4587,chemistry,are there other classes of compounds responsible for the red and yellow colors found in flowers Interest in colors specifically dyes was a real motivator for serious chemical work Some of the early efforts were aiming to mimic Tyrian purple also known as Royal Purple because in antiquity it was worth its weight in gold Two classes of molecules come to mind other than anthocyanins in phytochemistry such as the closely related flavones (its root means yellow) and the distinct carotenes (its root means carrot but also responsible for flamingo color) Can the red colors that give a normal anthocyanin pH response arise from pigments held in an acidic environment in the plant A real sharp organic chemist by the name of Richard Willstatter proposed this in the early 1900s He was working on determining the structure of the pigment responsible for the blue color in cornflower He extracted the same substance coming from a rose and proposed that all flower colors were due to a different pH in the sap As your experiment clearly points out however alkaline conditions are typically required for the blue anion A Japanese group argued that alkaline conditions in the sap were unlikely and that instead these different colors can be explained by the formation of metal-organic complexes It wasn't until 2005 that a definitive crystal structure was determined from the cornflower pigment called protocyanin It turns out that the blue color comes from a supermolecule containing one Fe$^{3+}$ one Mg$^{2+}$ two Ca$^{2+}$ six anthocyanin and six flavone molecules packaged together in a complex structure This color as I vaguely recall remains blue from pH 7 until pH 1 This agreed with some earlier evidence which suggested a complex species by the temperature dependence of the pigment These are not easy studies to conduct and I'm not familiar with how in-depth red colors have been studied but it is certainly possible a complex species is actually how the red pigments form in vivo Keeping in mind that plant vacuoles have a pH on the order of 5 we'll generally notice a loss in red above pH 3 in solution for a pure anthrocyanin in solution as hydration of the cation occurs Stability of the color and thus cation obviously must be obtained either via copigmentation or with metals in a plant
4576,chemistry,Sigma-Aldrich gives a very useful table outlining what the different purity levels are and suggested applications I was less successful at finding equal documentation from some of the other suppliers but the analysis for the purity of the chemicals they sell is in the catalog and on the bottle In general technical grade or laboratory grade are the lowest purity ACS Reagent grade means that the chemical conforms to specifications defined by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society (but Aldrich ReagentPlus means >95% pure) So ACS Reagent grade chemicals should be comparable from different suppliers Analytical grade is generally the most pure For some of the other grades such as HPLC grade solvents the issue is less about overall purity than about being free of substances that would interfere with a particular application I've reproduced a piece of the table below to give you an idea of the information available
4618,chemistry,In the future please specify where your equation came from justify its use and specify all of your parameters When only a concentration gradient is present the diffusion coefficient $D$ is typically described by Fick's first law of diffusion To determine $D$ in these terms we must know the flux $j$ and the gradient $d c / dx $ $c=$ concentration of our species divided by the volume and $x$ is the distance this occurs over Flux $j$ is the (flow quantity/time)/area or (flow rate)/area Fluxes depending on potential gradients are molecular but bulk flow flux is called convective Here we have molecular flux present and the units of this are kmol/(m$^2 \cdot$ s) (It's true that diffusion creates its own convection but there is no bulk flow so we ignore this diffusion-induced convection ) Properly our flux is the product of a transport property by the gradient of the driving force $ j = (D) ($Gradient of driving force$)$ Note that $D$ has units of m$^2$/s For example $D$ is $10^{-5}$ $10^{-9}$ $10^{-10}$ m$^2$/s for some gases liquids and solids respectively at STP Now let's think back to basic physics Say we have a feather at $h$ height here on Earth and we drop it It will experience an acceleration due to gravity $g$ Remember that gravity has units m/s$^2$ We can estimate the time it takes to travel distance $h$ crudely by dimensional analysis knowing that $g$ has units of m/s$^2$ and $h$ has units of m then time is simply $\sqrt{\frac{h}{g}}$ In fact the equation that describes this is $h = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$ and so we actually needed to multiply our original answer by $\sqrt{2}$ In the same way we can crudely estimate the time by dimensional analysis on the diffusion coefficient $D$ with units m$^2$/s and going a distance with units of m So we need to take the distance$^2$ divided by $D$ to get seconds Say ( $0 01$m )$^2$ divided by $10^{-9}$ m$^2$/s gives $10^5$ seconds which is about 1 1 days This could easily be 4 days if we needed to multiply by 3 7 which is certainly possible if your orifice is small It is calculating these other things which turns out to be tricky Although it's obvious the single easiest thing you can do is switch to a gas when considering just diffusion because a gas would take on the order of 10 seconds because $0 01^2/(10^{-5}) = 10$ You can also change the time by introducing another flux such as by stirring the solution A better answer requires differential equations Are you sure you want to venture down that road
4580,chemistry,Look at the II-VI options from a chemical perspective For silicon Group III boron p-doping would be replaced by Group II beryllium doping and Group V phosphorus n-doping would be replaced by Group VI sulfur doping The beryllium would tend to act like a Lewis base that donates a pair of electrons to some nearby silicon atom forming a stronger and more localized bond than is possible with the odd electron count created by boron doping Similarly the sulfur would tend to act like a Lewis acid and form a localized sulfide bond with some nearby silicon atom versus the odd electron count created by phosphorus So the main reason for picking elements immediately next door (off by one electron) is to avoid introducing paired electrons which on average will bond more strongly and more locally via a Lewis base-acid process That said there's enough complexity going on there that it's still possible that you could get II-VI or maybe even I-VII doping to work in the right situations
4585,chemistry,I can partially answer the question I know what is happening to solution B I don't know of a more stable version One potential problem is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the starch into glucose which does not form the blue complex $$\ce{nH2O + (C6H10O5)}_n \ce{-&gt;nC6H12O6}$$ For the timing to be off the metabisulfite must also be decomposing either by reducing glucose or by reacting with dissolved oxygen I'm not sure what the specific process is nor do I know how to stop it
4591,chemistry,(not yet a fully grown answer experiment still pending) I heard that $\ce{CO2}$/$\ce{H2CO3}$/$\ce{HCO3-}$ is responsible for fresh taste of water @NickT Chloramine has a very characteristic smell so Manishearth could most probably tell us whether this was the smell/taste So here are first questions for @Manishearth does water that has been boiled and then cooled to the same temperature taste similar to the taste you're asking for What about de-ionized water Of course there's also that average-of-all-that-has-ever-been-in-the-freezer taste
13456,chemistry,Maybe OP has already contacted the authors of this paper by now but this was interesting I'm no expert but I can Google things and this was too long for a comment Antisymmetric exchange At first I thought it was simply an exchange interaction where the wave function's sign is changed during exchange now I don't think it's so simple Antisymmetric exchange is also known as DM-interaction (for Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) I don't know exactly what it is here is the original paper citation - can't find it anywhere though I E Dzyaloshinskii Thermodynamic theory of weak ferromagnetism in antiferromagnetic substances Sov Phys JETP 5(6) 1259-1272 (1957) A definition A slideshow which contains some more info (slides 16-23) J-Strain Reading this J-strain isn't the only strain that's referenced in this paper Also referenced within is G-Strain which has a more elucidating Wikipedia article So maybe it's safe to say like G-Strain J-strain is the broadening of the distributed exchange coupling constants (a k a J-values) Inferred from a line in the paper Both proteins exhibit distributed J-values (J-strain) What did J-strain have to do with the experiment The observed J-strain which presumably represents a distribution of protein conformations “locked in” upon freezing the samples Where does the broadening of the J-values (exchange coupling constants) a k a J-strain come from Well apparently there's this thing called J-coupling that seems relevant J-coupling is also known as indirect dipole-dipole coupling and gives info about molecule interconnectivity J-coupling relates nuclei to local electrons (All this is from the J-coupling article) The broadening of the lines may come from anisotropic interactions which affect nuclear spin energy levels Sure enough the paper says it can't rule out anisotropy An Alternative source Non-homogeneous regions in the sample which could go back to the frozen/locked conformations I still think it'd be great if someone doing physics research in this field could elucidate some more though Another J-coupling Webpage (U Wisc) Of course I should cite the original paper Evidence for Antisymmetric Exchange in Cuboidal [3Fe?4S]+ Clusters Linked in question
4598,chemistry,For Structures and Energies Answer Hazy Try Again Later People can talk on this subject for literally days It mostly comes down to computational expense vs accuracy - if you have a larger system you can't afford the fancier functionals The absolute highest accuracy state of the art functional-wise would probably be those using the Random-Phase Approximation ( e g ) and also the use of more complex range separation techniques (including the Coulomb-Attenuated Method mentioned below) Having said that a lot of people just use B3LYP for everything B3LYP is parametrised for low- Z main-group chemistry and so does reasonably well there It's a hybrid functional (i e it includes the exact Hartree-Fock form exchange operator) so it's not the cheapest I tend to use the series of PBE PBE0 TPSS - their only parameters are physical constants so they should never give surprisingly bad results A couple of basic guidelines though (which should be taken as as far as I know s) If you have a delocalised system you want exact exchange (so a hybrid functional like PBE0 B3LYP M06x etc ) Without this most functionals will over-delocalise the orbitals If you have a system in which dispersion forces are important worry Then use something like $\omega$B97XD which includes empirical dispersion corrections Some packages can also apply Grimme's empirical dispersion corrections to any functional If you have a periodic system you probably want to use screened exchange rather than full exact exchange - something like HSE (which tails off the exact exchange past a certain range) rather than PBE0 should be faster while not significantly less accurate For TDDFT Probably CAM-B3LYP Fortunately this is a bit easier Firstly you want something that incorporates exact exchange (a hybrid functional) which quickly rules out many functionals Pure GGAs and LDAs give qualitatively wrong answers for states involving charge transfer Secondly functionals that include long-range exchange corrections such as CAM-B3LYP also give better results Also look out for triplet instabilities which can be a problem with the introduction of HF exchange ( David Tozer is my go-to author for TDDFT testing though I would warn that despite the above answer I've never used TDDFT in production ) (Now bring on the functional flamewar )
5041,chemistry,Okay this is not so much of an answer as it is a summary of my own progress on this topic after giving it some thought I don't think it's a settled debate in the community yet so I don't feel so much ashamed about it ) A few of the things worthy of note are The bond energy found by the authors for this fourth bond is 13 2 kcal/mol i e about 55 kJ/mol This is very weak for a covalent bond You can compare it to other values here or to the energies of the first three bonds in triple-bonded carbon which are respectively 348 266 and 225 kJ/mol This fourth bond is actually even weaker than the strongest of hydrogen bonds ($\ce{F…H–F}$ at 160 kJ/mol) Another point of view on this article could thus be “valence bond necessarily predicts a quadruple bond and it was now precisely calculated and found to be quite weak” The findings of this article are consistent with earlier calculations using other quantum chemistry methods (e g the DFT calculations in ref 48 of the Nature Chemistry paper) which have found a bond order between 3 and 4 for molecular dicarbon However the existence of this quadruple bonds is somewhat at odds with the cohesive energy of gas-phase dicarbon which according to Wikipedia is 6 32 eV i e 609 kJ/mol This latter value is much more in line with typical double bonds reported at an average of 614 kJ/mol This is still a bit of a mistery to me…
4611,chemistry,Polylactic acid polymers are creating a lot of interest these days because they're biodegradable On the downside corn starch is often one of the starting materials and corn is also used as a food source so there's some controversy over the wisdom of this approach I think I've found a site that takes the approach you're basing your question on but there are a couple of issues with the equation you've written So I'll answer this question in two parts Plastic from starch is what you saw in the video; PLA from starch is what you asked about Plastic from starch The recipe for the plastics-from-starch uses starch glycerol acetic acid (the $\ce{C2H4O2}$ in your equation) and water as a solvent (They do not add lactic acid the $\ce{C3H8O3}$ in your equation but lactic acid can be produced by hydrolysis of the starch ) With the starch-acetic acid-glycerol recipe you do not actually make a PLA polymer but a starch polymer that is somewhat like it instead ( Ref ) So starch is a polymer that looks like this In water it tends to ball up into globular clusters due to hydrogen bonding By adding acetic acid and heating the starch in water you denature the starch and turn it into disordered chains that stretch out When you let these disordered chains dry they become entangled and form a flexible film the plastic In this recipe the glycerol is included as a plasticizer so it is unchanged chemically in the reaction The glycerol also helps to keep the starch stretched out by stabilizing it with hydrogen bonding Plasticizers (as the name would indicate) are additives that increase the plasticity of a plastic and make it more durable or flexible Changing the amount of glycerol in the recipe can have a big effect on the strength of the plastic film you make This is the process you're seeing in the videos I think Making PLA from starch This is going to be a bit of a challenge to explain depending on your understanding of organic chemistry but hopefully the pictures will help When you make PLA commercially you digest starch usually with a bacteria to turn it into lactic acid (see picture below for the structure of lactic acid) This lactic acid must be purified to make a high quality product If you just combine a bunch of lactic acid molecules to make PLA one water molecule would be lost each time they combine sort of like this (This is an acid and alcohol combining not two acids but the idea is the same ) The water in the polymerization reaction leads to a poor quality plastic So in commercial synthetic schemes two purified lactic acid molecules are reacted to form lactide they come together in a controlled condensation reaction with the loss of water ( Ref for picture ) Now you can use the lactide i e lactic acids with the water removed to do the polymerizat
4620,chemistry,I would expect it to depend on the pH of the mobile phase The charge of your stationary phase and whether you want the azide to elute will determine what charge you want on the azide Given that you should set the pH of the mobile phase either acidic or basic enough to ensure that the azide is fully charged in the direction that you want From Wikipedia Proteins have numerous functional groups that can have both positive and negative charges Ion exchange chromatography separates proteins according to their net charge which is dependent on the composition of the mobile phase By adjusting the pH or the ionic concentration of the mobile phase various protein molecules can be separated For example if a protein has a net positive charge at pH 7 then it will bind to a column of negatively-charged beads whereas a negatively charged protein would not By changing the pH so that the net charge on the protein is negative it too will be eluted If changing the pH is problematic apparently increasing the ionic strength can help shield the azide's charge from the column's charge Elution by changing the ionic strength of the mobile phase is a more subtle effect - it works as ions from the mobile phase will interact with the immobilized ions in preference over those on the stationary phase This shields the stationary phase from the protein (and vice versa) and allows the protein to elute
4601,chemistry,Because unlike other metal dissolution reactions the $\ce{H+}$ of $\ce{HNO3}$ isn't reduced-- the $\ce{NO3-}$ is (data/balanced reactions from Wikipedia ) $$\begin{align} \ce{NO3- + 4 H+ + 3 e- -&gt; NO + 2 H2O}\quad &amp; &amp; E^o_{red} = 0 96 V \\ \ce{NO3- + 2 H+ + e- -&gt; NO2 + H2O} \quad&amp; &amp; E^o_{red} = 0 79 V \\ \ce{Ag+(aq) + e- -&gt; Ag(s)} \quad&amp; &amp; E^o_{red} = 0 799 V \end{align}$$ Since the SRP of the $\ce{NO2}$ reaction looks smaller than that of $\ce{Ag+}$ (I may be wrong but by significant digits it can't be greater than $0 799$) one can conclude that it's the $\ce{NO}$ reaction that's occurring here And the $\ce{NO}$ reaction has a large enough SRP to oxidise $\ce{Ag+}$ Usually nitrogen compounds are pretty versatile when it comes to redox reactions since Nitrogen shows many oxidation states So the simple reason for why $\ce{HNO3}$ is so strong an oxidising agent (with respect to other acids) is that it has a different better path availible to it to get reduced Note that the exact reduction path (ie final reduction products/oxidation state) depends upon the comcentration of nitric acid--so much that copper can be oxidised in three different ways I had a table of this I'll post it later

4610,chemistry,Your guess is right the mechanism of charcoal regeneration is undoubtably temperature-induced desorption Gas molecules are adsorbed on the large surface area of activated carbon by a mechanism of physisorption (or physical sorption ) caused by weak nonspecific interactions ( van der Waals forces ) between gas molecules and the carbon surface Unlike chemisorption this process is reversible and since it involves only weak interactions it can actually be reversed by relatively small increases of temperature Wikipedia gives a specific example The activated carbon can adsorb a large amount of methanol vapours in ambient temperature and desorb it at a higher temperature (around 100 degrees Celsius) During the daytime the sunshine irradiates the collector so the collector is heated up and the methanol is desorbed from the activated carbon In desorption the liquid methanol adsorbed in the charcoal heats up and vaporizes You will surely notice the resemblance between this text and your case
